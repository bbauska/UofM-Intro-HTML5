    who has been using HTML for some years. In particular, the new options available in HTML5 and some 
    recommended policies for making sure that your page is accessible. HTML stands for HyperText Markup 
    Language, a way of marking up files so that browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) know how to display 
    your content as a web page. HTML uses tags to distinguish between content (what the user should see) 
    and the instructions for displaying them (make this a list, make this a link to a different page, show

<h3 id="course-syllabus">Course Syllabus</h3>

<p>Welcome to Introduction to HTML5. This course is an introduction to
how web pages are created, sent across the Internet, and viewed on your
computer, tablet, or smartphone.</p>

<p>This course is meant for the absolute beginner, but also touches on
information that may be new to someone who has been using HTML for some
years. In particular, the new options available in HTML5 and some
recommended policies for making sure that your page is accessible.</p>

<p><b><i>HTML</i></b> stands for HyperText Markup Language, a way of
marking up files so that browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) know how
to display your content as a web page. HTML uses <b><i>tags</i></b> to
distinguish between content (what the user should see) and the
instructions for displaying them (make this a list, make this a link to
a different page, show this picture, etc.)   There are so many things
you can do with HTML. While it is possible to make a long list of HTML
tags, this approach won&#39;t help you as much as practice with a smaller
subset. Therefore, we focus on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>What HTML is and how we got from the original version to HTML5,</p></li>
  <li><p>The &quot;magic&quot; behind the Internet and how your web page isn&#39;t just 
    one file, but many pieces put together by your browser using something called the 
    Response/Request Cycle,</p></li>
  <li><p>The syntax behind the tags - how to write good syntactic HTML,</p></li>
  <li><p>The semantics behind the tags - some tags have special meaning and are 
    extremely useful if you want to make your pages accessible. Accessible 
    pages are ones that can be accessed by the widest range of people and 
    that includes those who have  physical or cognitive disabilities, and</p></li>
  <li><p>Getting your page on the web - This class will <b>not</b> require you to 
    post your site on the Internet. However, you will learn how to publish your 
    site if you choose. (And we hope you do and share your work with me and 
    others in the class.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the
importance of good habits and examples of potential pitfalls. This
course is about learning the proper syntax of HTML5 and <b>styling is
not covered</b>. You can see an <a href="https://intro-webdesign.com/v3/index-html-only.html" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example Web
Design for Everyone site</a> for reference. However, upon completion of
this course you will be ready to take the next course in this Web Design
for Everybody Specialization, Introduction to CSS3.</p>

<h3><b>Participation Strategies</b></h3>

<p>Engaged learning looks different for everybody. In this course, we
hope you will define your own measures of success and engage with the
material in a way that best suits your needs. We recognize and celebrate
the diverse ways learners engage in courses. As you go through this
course, we hope you will reflect on your unique skills, needs, and
aspirations, and engage in the course material in a way that aligns with
your own goals. While the course provides time estimates for completion,
you should feel empowered to engage in the material in whatever ways
make sense to you.</p>

<h3><b>Community Engagement</b></h3>

<p>We expect everyone to be mindful of what they say and its potential
impact on others. The goal is to have respectful discussions that do not
violate the community space created for these conversations. Here are
some productive ways to engage in this course: </p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Participate:</b> This is a community. Read what others have written 
    and share your thoughts.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Stay curious:</b> Learn from experts and each other by listening and 
    asking questions, not making assumptions.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Keep your passion positive:</b> When replying to a discussion forum 
    post, respond with thoughts on what was said, not about the person who posted. 
    Avoid using all caps, too many exclamation points, or aggressive language.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We expect all learners to abide by our full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Ucy-lT33FmkDDYdtxHEJ_nRytVLr_XGRVq2moAsPB4/edit" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learner
Engagement Policy</a>. We will specifically be monitoring this course
for language that could be considered inflammatory, incivil, racist, or
otherwise unacceptable for this learning space, and we will remove
language deemed such.</p>

<p><em>Note regarding “study groups” outside of the platform</em>: While
learners are encouraged to interact with one another using communication
tools offered within the learning platform, note that any study groups
formed outside of this platform, such as over social media or
communication applications and websites (e.g., WhatsApp) are not
affiliated, endorsed, or moderated by the University of Michigan. If you
receive an invitation to an outside study group mentioning the course
and claiming to have any official connection to U-M or individual
instructors, please exercise caution as this may be an attempted
scam.</p>

<h3><b>Final Project: Peer Review Assignment</b></h3>

<p>This course will culminate in the creation of an HTML document. You
will be provided with an example document and asked to style it. This
will not be a creative project, rather one that shows you can write
syntactically correct code. You can see an <a href="https://example-site-2.wd4e-html.repl.co/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example Web Design for
Everyone site</a> for reference. We will be peer grading this assignment
which means that you will grade the code created by your fellow students
and they will grade yours. But don&#39;t worry, we all want each other to
succeed in my courses!</p>

<h3><b>Academic Honesty</b></h3>

<p>All submitted work should be your own and academic dishonesty is not
allowed. Academic dishonesty can be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Copying words, ideas, or other materials from another source without 
    giving credit to the original author</p></li>
  <li><p>Copying answers or copying from your peers within the course</p></li>
  <li><p>Employing or allowing another person to alter or revise your work, 
    and then submitting the work as your own</p></li>
  <li><p>Using Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, to create or edit 
    your work and submitting that work as your own, unless you were instructed 
    to use AI as part of the assignment</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Tips for Success</b></h3>

<p>This course assumes absolutely no previous knowledge. In each module
you will be asked to do the following:</p>

<h3>Watch video lectures</h3>

<p>The information has been broken down into pieces to help you learn
the material in the smallest chunks that still give you enough
information to do something with it. The goal is to give you the ability
to listen to these during any time you have. You will find that some of
the videos have material that makes sense to you at once. Sometimes you
may want to replay other videos to clarify the material. </p>

<h3>Code with video lectures</h3>

<p>Some of the videos are not traditional lectures, instead they are
videos where I demonstrate the concepts from an earlier lecture. I
highly recommend that you code along with me while you watch these
videos. <em>[The key to success in this course is in writing code.]</em>
I put these videos in so that you have something specific to practice.
It is also a great way for you to see how often I mess up when I am
coding!!</p>

<h3>Change the video speed to one that works best for you</h3>

<p>You may find that you can speed the videos up and still retain the
information. On the other hand, my mom is always telling me I talk too
quickly so you may want to slow the videos down. The important thing is
to find something that works well for you. Use the in-­video quizzes to
help you gauge how your learning is going.</p>

<h3>Readings &amp; optional materials</h3>

<p>Each week will include reading material. It is impossible to learn
everything you need to learn just by listening to the lectures. Some of
the material will come from a (free) online textbook. Other material
will be other online readings.</p>

<p>There will also be optional material provided in many of the weeks.
These may range from links to recent articles to videos on pioneers in
the fields of design and accessibility. None of these materials will be
required for the quizzes, but rather provide additional ways for you to
branch out and learn more about the history of the field or the emerging
ideas.</p>

<h3><b>Course Support</b></h3>

<p>Questions and discussion of course material should take place within
the course itself. Please do not contact instructors or teaching
assistants off the platform, as responding to individual questions is
virtually impossible. We encourage you to direct your questions to the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html/discussions/forums/aWM4OyvhEe6u3BIzJLH0cQ" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Course
Support Discussion Forum</a>, where your question might be answered by a
fellow learner or one of our course team members. For technical help
please contact the <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera Learner Help
Center</a> support forums.</p>

<h3><b>Accessibility</b></h3>

<p>We are committed to developing accessible learning experiences for
the widest possible audience. We recognize that learners with
disabilities (including but not limited to visual impairments, hearing
impairments, cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities) might need
more specific accessibility-related support to achieve learning goals in
this course.</p>

<p>Please use the <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/187/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=3021&amp;RequestorType=Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
accessibility feedback form</a> to let us know about any accessibility challenges such
as urgent issues that keep you from making progress in the course (e.g.,
missing or inadequate alt-text, captioning errors).</p>

<p><b>Third-party sites and software:</b> While the University of
Michigan is not responsible for the accessibility of third-party sites
or applications that may be linked from this course, we still encourage
you to report associated third-party accessibility issues so that we can
ensure you are able to participate. In such cases, we may contact you
for additional information as we investigate ways of removing
accessibility barriers or to suggest accessible alternatives.</p>

<h3><b>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</b></h3>

<p><b>We welcome all learners to this course.</b> People like you are
joining from all over the world and we value this diversity. We strive
to create a community of mutual respect and trust, where people from all
backgrounds, identities and views are valued and heard without the
threat of bias, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination. We pay
attention to your feedback, how different types of learners experience
this course, and aim to make improvements so the course can best serve
everyone. We hope you enjoy learning about topics that are important to
you. </p>

<h3><b>Technology</b></h3>

<p>Below is a list of technologies that you will use to participate in
this course. I recommend that you spend time reading the brief
description of each technology before jumping into the course. By doing
this, you will have a better idea of what to expect and can create a
plan for how you will approach taking this course. </p>

<h3>Coursera platform</h3>

<p>If you are new to Coursera and you want to familiarize yourself with
the platform, read the <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/categories/201216173" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help Articles in Coursera Help Center</a>. 
This is a good resource where you can find answers to many basic questions such 
as how to adjust video settings, how to submit assignments, and how to gain a 
course certificate.</p>

<h3>Gamut Tools</h3>

<p>This course uses a sharing tool called the Gamut Gallery. Throughout
the course you will be asked by your instructor to create your own work
related to the course content. The Gallery provides a digital place to
submit and share your own work, receive feedback, and pose questions to
other learners about their work. It will appear as an item titled,
“Ungraded App Item.” For more information about this tool and its use in
our courses, please see the Center for Academic Innovation’s 
<a href="https://ai.umich.edu/software-tos/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h3 id="replit">Replit</h3>

<p>In this course we will assume that students will use <a href="https://replit.com/~" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replit</a> to host their code. Replit is an
online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and sharing
code. Once you get the hang of using Replit you will be able to easily
share your code and your deployed website sites with your family and
peers. However, students may choose other hosting options if they
prefer.</p>

<h3>Sublime &amp; Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>If students choose not to use Replit, they will want to have an
editor to create their code.  Two common editors that you will see used
in this course and by others are <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sublime</a> and 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Visual Studio Code</a> (also called VSCode).  Both of these programs are free to 
download and use and there are also many online tutorials available to help learn the
software.</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>Replit has free <a href="https://docs.replit.com/category/hosting" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting</a> built-in –
they will often refer to it as &quot;sharing your repl.&quot;  There are other
free hosting services as well, including using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Pages</a>. Learning to use
Github Pages can take some time, but is a useful skill for advanced
learners.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi, I&#39;m Colleen van Lent and I&#39;m happy to welcome you to Introduction
to HTML5. I am very excited to teach this course because I love the idea
that we finally will have some course that really will explain the
basics to as many people as possible. I love working with people and I
love working with technology and I think the best thing we can do is
have as many people involved as possible to really make sure that we&#39;re
building things that everyone can use.</p>

<p>In this course, we will be covering the basics. I really can&#39;t emphasize
enough that we will be starting at the very basic building blocks.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 04. what this course will cover (09) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image004.png"
  title="What this course will cover: The Basics" 
  alt="What this course will cover: The Basics." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>We&#39;ll start off talking about what&#39;s called syntax and semantics.
What is the actual code that people write in order to make a webpage a
webpage? Are there any special meanings behind any of these words that
can convey special information to those who may not be able to access
the web the same way I do? Perhaps, someone who uses special
accessibility tools.</p>

<p>After we cover the syntax and semantics, we&#39;re going to talk more
about this accessibility idea that I just alluded to. This idea that if
we&#39;re going to build a webpage, what do we need to do to make sure the
most people as possible can access the information?</p>

<p>We&#39;re also going to be talking about getting started in technology and
writing code. When I mean talking about getting started, I mean really
talking about getting started, right down to you and I are going to walk
through together on how we&#39;re going to create a file. One of the things
I think that really trips people up when they&#39;re starting to learn
computer science or any type of technology-based criteria, or
curriculum, is that professors or instructors say let&#39;s get started,
here&#39;s your homework. Go ahead and do it and everyone just kind of stops
because they&#39;re not sure where to get started. I really want to be there
for you to show you how to get started and get off on the right foot.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Week 1: What happens when you type an address into a URL, what tools

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s talk about what we&#39;ll cover in this course. In Week One the
focus is on questions. It&#39;s not on coding, it&#39;s on questions. I want you
to understand what happens when you type something into the URL. If you
type in <b>www.introwebdesign.com</b>, how is this page magically
appearing in front of your browser? I also want to talk to you about
what types of tools you are going to need in order to code.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to talk about editors and browsers and other different
software tools because I want you to know right from the start what
you&#39;re going to need in order to succeed in this class. Finally, we&#39;re
really going to talk about HTML5. What happened to HTML1? What happened
to HTML2? What is this evolution of what&#39;s going on with web design and
the languages we use? In Week One, again, almost no coding. Really, just
giving you an idea of how the web works and why it&#39;s important for you
to be able to interact with people and with code that&#39;s being used to
create your sites.</p>

<p>Week Two, we&#39;re going to talk a little bit of theory, and then,
unfortunately for some people, a lot of code. There&#39;s this idea of
something called the Document Object Model, upon which all webpages are
built. If I can get you to understand just a little bit about that, then
later on, if you decide to go off and use WordPress or some other
software to make your own website, you&#39;re going to be able to really
understand what&#39;s going on so much better.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to talk about things called contextual tags and headings and
different things we can use to make our site have different meanings and
different appearances. We&#39;re going to talk about links, images, lists,
tables, and also multimedia in case you would like to add any video or
audio to your site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Week 3: Putting it Together." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Week Three, we&#39;re really going to put it all together. At this point,
you should know just enough about HTML5 where you&#39;ll be dangerous. Where
you can create something that works but doesn&#39;t work all the time. In
Week Three, we&#39;re going to put it together, and I&#39;m going to talk to you
about some of the things that are often overlooked, such as validating
your code. How can we make sure that the code that you wrote doesn&#39;t
just look good, it&#39;s syntactically correct? It&#39;s going to work
everywhere. Again, when we validate your code, we&#39;ll talk about the
syntax but we&#39;ll also talk about accessibility, which is hey, we
validated your code to make sure the rules are there. Let&#39;s also
validate and make sure that the meaning is there, as well. Finally,
we&#39;ll talk about what&#39;s called domain name registration and web hosting
because it&#39;s a lot more fun to make websites if you can actually put it
out there on the internet and let your friends and family see it, as
well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. final project (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Final Project: Create multipage website, pass W3C validation &amp; WAVE accessibility review." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Finally, we&#39;ll work on a final project where you&#39;ll put together a
lot of different things that you&#39;ve been learning. You are going to
create what we call, syntactically valid multipage website. Your site
will have at least two to three pages. After you&#39;ve done your coding,
you&#39;ll run it through to make sure it validates and it&#39;s very
accessible.</p>

<p>Your final project is actually going to be something that&#39;s a little bit
ugly, I&#39;m going to admit to right now because we&#39;re not going to be
talking about styling, we&#39;re not talking about different things. I
really just want you to understand the HTML5 language and that&#39;s all
about content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 09. who is this class for? (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image009.png" 
  title="This class is for persistent, non-nerd beginners" 
  alt="This class is for persistent, non-nerd beginners." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s talk logistics. Let&#39;s talk about who this class is for. Who am
I aiming for my star student? I&#39;m really looking forward to teaching the
complete beginner.</p>

<p>This class is not for those people who were building a computer down in
their basement when they were 12 years old. You are very welcome to hang
out with us but we are really here to talk about how we, through
persistence, can create a website. One of the things that I&#39;m kind of
anti about is the word passion. Now, I&#39;m passionate about teaching you
this material but I don&#39;t really feel like you need to be passionate
about technology or passionate about computing to really get a lot out
of this class. Instead, it&#39;s about persistence. I&#39;d like you to just
hang in there and learn enough that you can go off and help people build
better technology.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 10. who is the teacher? (13) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image010.png" 
  title="The educator is Colleen van Lent, PhD - University of Michigan" 
  alt="The educator is Colleen van Lent, PhD - University of Michigan." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>A little bit about of who I am, I have a PhD in computer science
which is really the least important part of my qualifications to teach
this class. Instead, I have two decades of teaching experience and I&#39;ve
taught a wide range of different students. My emphasis is always been on
education and I&#39;m somewhat famous for running around the classroom
helping people debug their code, finding out what&#39;s going on here,
finding out what&#39;s going on there. This whole idea of teaching this
class is kind of novel to me because I am sitting here not moving. The
important part is that I really do care about people succeeding and I am
hoping that I can help you take your skills to the next level.</p>

<p>Here is what everyone wants to know. In this class, what kind of
workload will there be and how will you be evaluated? There are going to
be weekly videos. Some of them are like this, a lecture format. You
should really feel free to watch them anywhere but I also like to
include some videos that are going to be much more demo format. By that,
I mean you want to watch the video with a computer next to you, so you
can type along and test it out and try it.</p>

<p>There will be weekly readings. Most of them will be from a free
online textbook but there may be some other online articles I include as
well, if I happen to come across something that&#39;s very timely for what
we&#39;ve been learning. There will be weekly assessments, typically, in the
form of quizzes. There will be that final project and I put in here
warning; it will be ugly. I don&#39;t mean that the process will be ugly. I
think you&#39;ll find it very straightforward. It&#39;s just again, I can&#39;t
emphasize enough that this class is about the language HTML5, it&#39;s not
about creating beautiful sites. It&#39;s about you really learning just the
building blocks and it&#39;s always so much easier to build something ugly
the first time than build something beautiful.</p>

<p>How will you succeed in this class? In a perfect world, you would be
coding with two or three other people and you&#39;d be talking and you&#39;ll
never be coding alone. I&#39;m hoping that you&#39;ll create a community,
probably through the message boards. I need you to work smart. One of
the things that kills me is when people say I spent three or four hours
working on this. I never want to hear that from a student. Instead, I
feel that if you&#39;ve ever run into a problem when you&#39;re coding, you
should stop after 10, 15, 20 minutes max and go walk away. Go get help
from someone, take a break, think about something else. It&#39;s all about
working smart, not necessarily hard. Next, you really need to learn how
to look things up on your own. There is no way I can teach you
everything you need to know about HTML5, and you wouldn&#39;t want me to, it
would be very boring. Instead, you need to feel the confidence to go out
and use search engines to look up the topics that you&#39;re interested
in.</p>

<p>My job is to give you those key words and key ideas so you know what
it is you want to search for. Finally, you really need to practice,
practice, practice. You will not succeed in this course unless you&#39;ve
written the code yourself and really tried to muster your way through
some of the mistakes and typos that you&#39;re going to have. Let&#39;s just
review. Once again, this class is for beginners, and I&#39;m excited to have
you join us.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re done with this class, you will have the ability to write
and understand HTML5 code. You&#39;re not leaving as a developer but you are
going to leave as someone who understands code. Finally, one of the key
things that I&#39;m going to stress throughout this whole course, is that
you will understand the importance of accessibility in technology. If
when this course was done, I had even one student who said, hey you know
what, I&#39;m going to go on and I might not be a coder but I am going to go
work with somebody else to help make their code more accessible, I would
be thrilled with that. Welcome to the course and I hope you have a lot
of fun as you learn more about HTML5.</p>

<h3>Required Course Materials</h3>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>It is really difficult to find a textbook that focuses on just the
basics. In the past I used a textbook that covered too many &quot;extras&quot;.
The new version of this course (and the entire specialization) will be
using two online resources.</p>

<p>The first resource is a big-picture tutorial from Shay Howe called <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a>. You can also purchase a paper copy of the book 
if you prefer, but everything you need is free and online. This book isn&#39;t 
perfect - it covers more than I would like to cover but it is a really good start. I
do my best to direct you to sections that most closely follow what I
will be covering in each video lecture.</p>

<p>The second resource is the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3 Schools tutorial</a>. This
tutorial is more of a dictionary of terms where you can quickly find
specific topics.</p>

<p>While you are reading, make sure to look closely for code. The Shay
Howe site uses CodePen - a tool that lets you see the code and the
output.  Clicking on the code will also take you to the CodePen site
where you can try changing the code to see what happens. W3Schools has a
“Try It Now” option. Many students really appreciate the ability to
change existing HTML code and see (immediately) what it does. So if you
would like the ability to write and test snippets of code, this is a
good resource. Don&#39;t forget that you still need to validate your
code.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>The <b>preferred</b> way to code in this class is editor software
(Notepad, TextWrangler, Sublime, etc). Recently I have been using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Visual Studio Code</a> and I really like it. The software is free and works on 
most types of computers. If you are a paid learner you will want to use 
<a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replit</a>.</p>

<h3>Optional Course Resources</h3>

<p>The textbook I link to throughout the course has nice, short chapters
that go well with nice short lectures. These other (free) online
resources are just as good if not maybe even a little better in some
cases. So feel free to read them now or at the end of the class to help
reinforce what you learn over the next few weeks.</p>

<h3>Codecademy - <em>Optional and more of a long-term prospect</em></h3>

<p>If you are looking for even more hands-on practice many people use
the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a> website. This
site awards badges as you complete skills. This site is free, but
<b><i>registration is required</i></b>. My advice is to make sure you
are doing more than just trying to &quot;get through,&quot; and focusing on the
concepts that you are practicing.</p>

<h3>HTML files from lectures</h3>

<p>At the site linked below, you will find html files discussed in the
lecture videos.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intro-webdesign.com/resources.html" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML code examples </a></li>
</ul>

<p>Files with all the code and other text discussed in the videos are
available in the resources section of the course. These are available in
pdf and docx format.</p>

<h3>Lecture Slides</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p>To support learners, accessible lecture slides are provided as downloadable PDF 
    files below, and individually within each lecture video. Please note, sometimes the 
     slides will look slightly different from the videos since I like to update the slides 
     when things change. For instance, when I first created this course Internet Explorer 
     was a very popular browser. It has been replaced by Edge.</p></li>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 11. the evolution of html (1.02) (17) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image011.png" 
  title="1.02 The Evolution of HTML" 
  alt="1.02 The Evolution of HTML." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi. Today we&#39;re going to be talking about HTML5. Specifically what it
is, and why we aren&#39;t learning HTML1 instead. So what is HTML?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 12. what is html? (17) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image012.png" 
  title="What is HTML?" 
  alt="What is HTML?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. Markup languages are
actually very common. They&#39;re not the same as programing languages,
instead they&#39;re special languages that use tags to annotate or markup
documents. In HTML, the tags tell the browsers where you want to put
headings, images, lists, links, et cetera.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 13. .html files (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image013.png" 
  title=".html files" 
  alt=".html files." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>A .HTML file is a special kind of file. You&#39;ve already seen special file
extensions before. Whenever you open a file that has a .doc, your
computer knows to open it in Microsoft Word. If you see a file with .ppt
your computer knows, that&#39;s a Power Point file, I should open it in
Power Point. In the same way, when you computer sees the .html file, it
knows that it should open it in an internet browser such as Chrome,
Firefox or Safari. Your browser can read this file and it knows how to
display it on the screen. It&#39;s more than that, HTML file tags also allow
screen readers and other assisted devices to utilize the tags to present
the information in new and special ways.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 14. html files (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image014.png" 
  title="HTML files" 
  alt="HTML files." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So HTML is very similar to English, you can understand it even if you
don&#39;t know much about it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 15. example, html file (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image015.png"
  title="Example, HTML file"
  alt="Example, HTML file."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let&#39;s look at this example HTML file over here. Most of it is just a
typical English language. This is an important heading or h1 there. I am
going to include a link to the course page. But if you look closely, you
can see we&#39;ve added these little tiny tags that the browser use this to
know how to represent the material. So, h1 is just the heading tag. It
says to the browser, hey this is something really important. I want you
to put it in bigger font, and also if someone is using an assisted
device, I want them to know if this is something important. h2 also
displays some sort of importance, but not as much. I have a p tag for a
paragraph, and I have another tag down here called an anchor tag. To
let the browser know, I don&#39;t want you to just show this material, I
want you to actually link it to a different web page. So here&#39;s the
output when any browser would look at our code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 16. 'learning' html (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image016.png" 
  title="&#39;Learning&#39; HTML" 
  alt="&#39;Learning&#39; HTML." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In the beginning, learning HTML is mostly about learning all those
different tags that I showed you in that file. This is called learning
the syntax. It&#39;s how you learn which brackets to use, backslashes, and
different things like that. You spend most of your time going, oh, did I
remember that tag and did I write it the right way? That&#39;s very
short-lived.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17. 'learning' html, #2 (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image017.png" 
  title="&#39;Learning&#39; HTML, #2" 
  alt="&#39;Learning&#39; HTML, #2." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In just a little amount of time, you&#39;re gonna gain the confidence to not
worry about your syntax and instead to be thinking about the semantics
or the meaning behind the tags. How important is this information that
I&#39;m trying to get across, and is this the right tag to be using? If
someone&#39;s searching my page, can they find what they&#39;re looking for?
Even if they can&#39;t see the text, can they use the tags to navigate
through it?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18. html, the early years (20) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image018.png" 
  title="HTML, The Early Years" 
  alt="HTML, The Early Years." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So what happened to HTML1? Why are we using something called HTML5?
Well, let&#39;s talk about the early years. HTML was created in 1990 as a
way to electronically connect different documents via hyperlinks. Hence,
this idea of a web of connections. What was happening, is that
scientists were using the Internet to list their different research
papers, and you would have a long list, each paper independent of the
other. But, HTML, gave you ways that you could read a paper, and right
within the text, link to another exciting physics paper. Because the
audience from HTML tended to be people like my dad up there in the
corner, they were nuclear physicists, they didn&#39;t care about things such
as color, images, or anything that wasn&#39;t science related, and that was
the key.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 19. html, early years, #2 (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image019.png" 
  title="HTML, The Early Years, #2" 
  alt="HTML, The Early Years, #2." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>HTML was intended to work across any platform. And in order to do this
you really had to avoid things such as special fonts or different colors
or anything that was more about layout than content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 20. mosaic is introduced (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image020.png" 
  title="Mosaic is introduced" 
  alt="Mosaic is introduced." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>However, in 1993 Mosaic emerged as the first graphical browser. And
what that means is that it was a first browser to actually introduce the
idea of images and when that happened, there was a lot of debate among
the research community as to whether or not this was a good thing. The
pioneers really wanted to keep it simple content based, let everyone
access it. But the innovators were saying no. People like pictures, they
like layout. They like that even as much as they like the content. So
there is a big battle between how the Internet should evolve from that
point.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 21. mosaic (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image021.png" 
  title="Mosaic" 
  alt="Mosaic." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So after Mosaic emerged, the use of the Internet just absolutely
exploded, and more and more people were using it for commercial means,
instead of just for doing research. Mosaic had challengers though, in
the form of Netscape, Internet Explorer and other browsers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 22. the browser wars (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image022.png" 
  title="The Browser Wars" 
  alt="The Browser Wars." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>This was the start of what we call the browser wars. Each of these
browsers decided that they wanted to create these proprietary tags, tags
that would only work on their browser. Some of the examples were
marquee, where you could have scrolling text, or blink which would only
work on some of the browsers and not others.</p>

<p>Other tags weren&#39;t proprietary, they actually worked on any browser,
but they went against the original spirit of HTML. They were tags such
as font or center, for centering your text or background color. This may
not sound like a bad thing, but some computers didn&#39;t have the access,
didn&#39;t have the ability to have all the different colors that other
computers might have. And this led to some really ugly looking
pages.</p>

<p>That also led to the origination of what we call the &quot;best viewed on&quot;
messages. When you went to a site you almost immediately told which
browser you should really view the site on. Otherwise, you weren&#39;t going
to get the optimal experience. We all in a way suffer from browser wars,
or best viewed on images today. Many times when you go to a page, you&#39;ll
see that you can&#39;t actually access the full content if you&#39;re on your
phone, unless you click on a link to the full website.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 23. web standards (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image023.png" 
  title="Web standards" 
  alt="Web standards." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>How did this happen? How did we get to the point where different
browsers weren&#39;t agreeing on the different roles that HTML should play?
This comes back to the idea that no one runs the Internet or the Web.
However, some groups have taken a more proactive role to try to help
standardize what&#39;s going on out there. The <b>first</b> is the
<b>Internet Engineering Task Force</b>, they really focus on the idea of
how the different networks should collaborate and how they should work
together.</p>

<p>The <b>second, World Wide Web Consortium</b>, instead deals with HTML
and the evolution of HTML, they want to know what kinds of tags the
browsers should and should not support. <b>Third</b>, and last, one of
the newest groups, <b>The Web Accessibility Initiative</b>, they want to
make sure, that no matter how people are accessing the web, they have
the same ability to view the content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. evolution of browsers (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image024.png" 
  title="Evolution of browsers" 
  alt="Evolution of browsers." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>We had this evolution of browsers that we&#39;ve been talking about. In
1990 to &#39;94 it was all very simple, text-based. In &#39;93, we talked about
how the images entered the scene, and pretty much exploded the Internet.
Cross-browser compatibility made many of the web pages just fall apart
and led to incredibly ugly code.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 2000 browsers went back to this idea of separating
content from style. And in 2005 it became standard practice to use HTML
files, which we are learning about in this course, to create the content
and CSS files to style it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 25. evolution of html (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image025.png" 
  title="Evolution of HTML" 
  alt="Evolution of HTML." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>So as the browsers evolved so did HTML. The way it tends to work in most
computer science and technology fields is that it&#39;s the coders and the
developers who push the standards. So as coders learned that there more
and more things that they wanted the ability to do, it&#39;s the browsers
job to keep up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 26. where are we at now? (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image026.png" 
  title="Where are we at now?" 
  alt="Where are we at now?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>So, where are we now? HTML5 is a cooperation between W3C and the Web
Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, and what they&#39;ve done is
they&#39;ve established these four guidelines for how HTML5 should be
approached as browsers go to support it.</p>

<p>The first idea is that new features should be based on HTML, CSS
which is the styling language, the DOM and JavaScript. Nothing more.
They want to reduce the need for external plug-ins, it&#39;s very
frustrating when you&#39;re on a browser and you find that you can&#39;t watch
the video that someone posted.</p>

<p>They also want to move so that mark up, or the mark up language can
replace scripting. If you find that more and more developers are writing
code to make something happen, get rid of the code and just make a
simple tag that can do it instead.</p>

<p>And finally, HTML5 should be device independent. It shouldn&#39;t matter
whether you&#39;re on your phone, you laptop, a PC or even on a screen
reader. You want everyone the same access to the information.</p>

  alt="Review of 1.02 The Evolution of HTML." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>When you think back over this module, there are certain lessons I
hope stick with you. The first is the idea that HTML is not a programing
language, but rather a way that browsers can translate documents into
viewable webpages. HTML was intended to facilitate many different
content types. Images, pictures, links, lists.</p>

<p>What we&#39;ve found throughout the history of the Internet, is that when
designers want to do something they tend to write nonstandard code to
force browsers to do it. So, this is why we&#39;re developing new standards
in HTML5 to handle these new requirements that people desire and push
browsers to adopt the new standards.</p>

  alt="1.03 How it Works: The &#39;Magic&#39; of Page Requests." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Today, let&#39;s talk about the request-response cycle or basically what
happens when you type something into the address bar of your browser.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 29. how does this all work? (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image029.png" 
  title="How Does This All Work?" 
  alt="How Does This All Work?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the things I think is really funny and I&#39;m guilty of it as
well, is that we all do things and we have no idea how they work. If I
were to ask you when you type in an address, what happens? This lecture
is actually one of the most technical of this entire class. I don&#39;t want
to feel like you need to memorize this or write it down, but I do think
it will help you understand what is going on as you learn HTML5.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 30. client/server relationship (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image030.png" 
  title="Client/Server Relationship" 
  alt="Client/Server Relationship." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the things you might want to understand is the client-server
relationship. Servers are basically machines that hold all the
resources. Our hope is that they&#39;re always connected to the network.
Clients are what we&#39;re using, where the machines that you use for
personal use; like laptops, phones, et cetera.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 31. networks; lan and wan (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image031.png" 
  title="Networks; LAN and WAN" 
  alt="Networks; LAN and WAN." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let me show you in this picture. It&#39;s common to use networks such as
something called a <b>LAN</b> or a <b>WAN</b>. A <b>LAN</b> is a local
area network, and so what I have right here is this idea that we can
have three different computers and they&#39;re all sharing one server. Why
would we want to do that? Well, a lot of times, you only have one
printer or one of the different resources. This way, all three machines
can work together and share that one resource.</p>

<p>The <b>LAN</b> is the local area network. Sometimes, you want to have
something larger or a wide area network. In movies, where the good guy
is breaking into the building to steal the software, what&#39;s typically
happened is they have this server that everyone who works in the
building can access but no one outside the building, or you can even
have it across different buildings but you don&#39;t want anyone from the
outside to be able to get your information.</p>

<p>Local area network is like your office building. A wide area network
might be a university, where you want to be able to share servers across
multiple buildings. The largest wide area network is, of course, the
Internet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 32. request/response cycle (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image032.png"
  title="Request/Response Cycle"
  alt="Request/Response Cycle."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Now we get back to that question of what happens when you type something
into the URL? What you&#39;re doing is that you the client are requesting a
web page and the server needs to respond with the appropriate files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 33. uniform resource locator (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image033.png"
  title="Uniform Resource Locator"
  alt="Uniform Resource Locator."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>When you type something in, this is called the URL. Every URL has three
parts. The <b>protocol</b>, how you want to connect, the <b>domain</b>,
which is the server, and then optionally, you can include the
<b>document</b>. So, even though you&#39;re typing in one URL, one of the
things to realize is that usually, you&#39;re actually requesting lots and
lots of files all at once.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 34. protocols (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image034.png" 
  title="Protocols" 
  alt="Protocols." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The protocols that most people have seen; the first one is
<b>HTTP</b>, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The second one,
<b>HTTPS</b>, is the same idea, only now we&#39;re having a more secure
protocol. So, if you&#39;re ever connecting to a bank or any place where
you&#39;re putting in passwords, make sure that the first thing you see in
that URL is HTTPS. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t connect.</p>

<p>The third one is called the File Transfer Protocol. It&#39;s a little bit
different. When you see HTTP, it&#39;s expecting that you&#39;re going to give
back and forth HTML5 code; with <b>FTP</b>, it could be any type of
file.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 35. domain names (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image035.png" 
  title="Domain Names" 
  alt="Domain Names." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>We have the protocol, now let&#39;s talk about what the domain names
represent. Usually, the domain names are something recognizable, such as
<b>umich.edu</b>, would be for University of Michigan. <b>Google.com,
wikipedia.org.</b> So, each of these sites has a different top-level
domain. How did you get them? How do some people get to be .<b>edu</b>
and some .<b>com</b>, some .<b>biz</b>, et cetera? Well, they&#39;re
actually determined by <b>ICAAN</b>. Their job is to go in and decide
which types of organizations qualify for different domains. I&#39;ve
included a link here if you want, you can go and see what the different
types are.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 36. ip addresses (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image036.png" 
  title="IP Addresses" 
  alt="IP Addresses." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>But the important thing to know is that your domain name is actually
mapped to an address. In the old days, like when my Dad was on the
Internet, if he wanted to connect to some place, he would actually type
in numbers; 185.261 et cetera, et cetera. Well, there&#39;s been a new
version of IP addresses, because every single client needs their own
address. If you think of how many people have laptops and smartphones,
we need a lot of different options.</p>

<p>With these IP addresses, you basically have sets of numbers, you have
these different sets right here, where each X can represent one of 16
different values. So, you can see we have a lot of options, over 300
trillion, in fact.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 37. the domain name server (dns)  (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image037.png" 
  title="The Domain Name Server (DNS)" 
  alt="The Domain Name Server (DNS)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>As I said, luckily for you, the domain name server lets you type in
something really simple like Umich or Google, and it&#39;s the one that
turns it into that really long number.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. document - last part of your url (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image038.png" 
  title="Document - Last part of your URL" 
  alt="Document - Last part of your URL." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The last part of your URL is the document. Sometimes you want to specify
a very specific document that you want to get. For instance, the contact
page, or in this case, another one I have the file that&#39;s inside a
folder. But sometimes you don&#39;t put a document at all. In fact, most of
the time, you don&#39;t. If you type in wikipedia.org or Facebook.com,
there&#39;s no filename. But that&#39;s okay. Every server has a default
document that it&#39;s going to return. Usually, it&#39;s called
<b>index.html</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. the request (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image039.png" 
  title="The Request" 
  alt="The Request." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>We know what it means when we&#39;re typing something in. We understand the
request. What happens though once we type that in, is we are actually
going to get back a lot of information. Headers, cookies, form data, all
the stuff that you don&#39;t see.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. the response (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image040.png" 
  title="The Response" 
  alt="The Response." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The important thing to know is that the server returns files, not web
pages. For a lot of us, we are very visual. So, when we type in a URL,
we&#39;re looking and we&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, here&#39;s my page.&quot; But sometimes the
browser might be returning something for different types of screen
readers, assistive technology, so it&#39;s not returning a web page, it&#39;s
returning lots and lots of files. Hopefully. I will admit that sometimes
the server can&#39;t fulfill the request. If it can&#39;t, it&#39;ll send back an
error code. I think a lot of you are familiar with 404, where it says,
&quot;File not found.&quot; That usually means you typed something in wrong. If
you get a 500 error, that actually means that the servers down. So, you
may as well go have a snack, do something fun, come back later and type
it in again.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="What happens in the address bar" 
  alt="What happens in the address bar." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I want to kind of do a live demo with you of what happens when we type
something in. I&#39;ve written it down for you. It looks up the domain, the
<b>DNS</b> returns an IP address, and then a whole bunch of files start
to be returned. Let&#39;s take a look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 42. example, school of information at u of michigan (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image042.png" 
  title="Example, School of Info at University of Michigan" 
  alt="Example, School of Info at University of Michigan." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>What I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve gone to the School of Information site at
the University of Michigan. I simply typed in <b>si.umich.edu</b>. I
didn&#39;t type in the protocol because it usually just defaults. What you
see here visually is a page. Student looking out, looking very inspired,
et cetera.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Inspect, School of Info at University of Michigan." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />

<p>But now, I&#39;m going to do a little trick here, where I right-click on the
screen, and I&#39;m going to choose the option that says, &quot;Inspect.&quot; A
window&#39;s going to pop up to the side here. I&#39;m going to say, &quot;You know
what? I would like to see all the information that&#39;s being returned when
I actually request this page.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m requesting one page, I&#39;m going to hit &quot;Refresh.&quot; If you look off to
the side, don&#39;t worry that you can&#39;t see the details. But you should see
that the single page is actually made up of lots and lots of files, and
each one of these files was a separate request.</p>

  title="Review, URL and Request/Response Cycle" 
  alt="Review, URL and Request/Response Cycle." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Okay. So, let&#39;s review. This was a kind of long video, where really
all I want you to come away from it with is the knowledge that every URL
has those three parts; the <b>protocol</b>, the <b>domain</b>, and the
<b>document</b>. And, realize that what you&#39;re creating is bigger than
just one file at a time. Every <b>request-response cycle</b> is usually
lots and lots of rounds of communication between the client and the
server. So, we&#39;re going to start off small. We&#39;re going to do one file
at a time, but you can always look ahead to building bigger and bigger
web applications.</p>

<h3>1.03 Browsers</h3>

<p>Browsers are constantly changing. Changing so much that it is
difficult to keep up with all of the changes once you pick a favorite.
Myself? I got a Mac a few years ago and have been using Chrome. But
oftentimes I switch to Firefox because it allows me to run some programs
that Chrome has trouble with. <b>So please remember that many times a
page that looks a certain way in one browser will look different in
another.</b>  I highly recommend that you check your page on two
different browsers if you ever get stuck on a site.</p>

<p>In the lecture video I will do my best to touch on some of the most
popular browsers. But I am including here a link to an optional reading
on <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-web-browser" 
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the &quot;best&quot; browsers</a>. 
 This is an optional reading because I don&#39;t like the popups that accompany 
 it.</p>
 
<p>Some people are very loyal to their browsers, any of my comments here
are just my views! I hope that we have taken some of the mystery away
from how browsers work and why there are so many.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch1-04">1.04 Looking at Your Browser Options (5:25)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 47. looking at your browser options (1.04) (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="1.04 Looking at Your Browser Options"
  alt="1.04 Looking at Your Browser Options."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the things that you might notice is that there are a lot of
different options for how you can view web pages, and these different
options are called your different browsers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 48. differing browsers (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image048.png" 
  title="Differing Browsers" 
  alt="Differing Browsers." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Different browsers have their pros and cons. I am not one of those
people who gets really passionate about having, using one over the
other. But I will tell you, as you become a web developer, if you decide
to, you&#39;re going to want to know some of these differences. It&#39;s
perfectly natural to have a preferred browser, for most people it&#39;s
whichever one was installed on their computer. But, when you want to
create websites, you might have one browser you use to look at things,
but you really want to test your site on multiple browsers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 49. internet explorer (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image049.png" 
  title="Internet Explorer" 
  alt="Internet Explorer." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So, let&#39;s talk about some of the differences. First, we have Internet
Explorer and for a long time, it was the most popular browser and that
was just because it was the one that came with Microsoft Windows. It
was, and always has been the worst of all browsers. A true piece of
shit.</p>

<p>It was platform-dependent and what that means is that it doesn&#39;t
automatically work if you have a Mac.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 50. microsoft edge (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image050.png" 
  title="Microsoft Edge" 
  alt="Microsoft Edge." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In 2015 Windows 10 came out and instead of including Internet Explorer
as a default, it&#39;s using something called the Microsoft Edge. An even
worse browser. Edge is meant to replace Internet Explorer. So people who
buy new computers are going to be using Edge. But don&#39;t forget people
don&#39;t buy new computers all the time or even if they do buy a new
computer, they might decide they still like Internet Explorer better. So
you basically want to make sure that you&#39;re considering both browsers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 51. google chrome (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image051.png" 
  title="Google Chrome" 
  alt="Google Chrome." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Another option is Google Chrome. Google Chrome was developed by,
surprise, Google, and it was a freeware that they created to be used on
Microsoft Windows. However, it was later re-written so it works on
Linux, Apple, Android, and most machines that you&#39;re going to come
across. The nice thing about Google Chrome is that they really focused
on security. Unlike Microsoft, they care more. Unlike Microsoft, they
get hacked one hell of a lot less. And this is partially why. Not so
lazy as Microsoft. If that’s something that you’re concerned about,
Chrome is a good way to go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 52. firefox (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image052.png" 
  title="Firefox" 
  alt="Firefox." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The next option is Firefox. Once again, the theme seems to be, I’m
always recommending free and open source browsers. What open source
means is that they&#39;ve actually shared their code with everyone (unlike
Microsoft) for how they created Firefox. And this is a great way to let
people make suggestions and improvements to it. It&#39;s also available for
Windows, macOS, Linux, and different BSD operating systems.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 53. browser usage; 2014 and 2017 (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image053.png"

  alt="Browser usage; 2014 and 2017." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>So who&#39;s using the different browsers? Back in 2014, I can show you that
Internet Explorer had a really big chunk of the market, right around
there. You had Internet Explorer 11, Internet Explorer 10, Internet
Explorer 9 etc. All pieces of shit. They had the biggest chunk and then
Chrome was getting a lot bigger as well as Firefox. Well, when we look
over here at 2017 though, we can see that Chrome really made a big surge
and up to 64% of desktops and laptops were using Google Chrome, followed
by Firefox, Internet Explorer etc. This is always going to change, it&#39;s
going to flux. You can&#39;t pick one browser and say hey, this is the new
one that&#39;s everyone is going to be using. And the other interesting
thing to kind of think about is, especially in this old map over here,
people use really old browsers because people like to use what they&#39;re
used to.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54. issues of accessibility (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image054.png" 
  title="Issues of Accessibility" 
  alt="Issues of Accessibility." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One thing that I&#39;m hoping all the students in my class take into
consideration though, is accessibility. Accessibility is basically the
ability of a browser to support all these special functionalities, and
all these new HTML5 tags, and all types of assistive technology.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 55. as of mar, 2018 how well browsers support the text (40) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="As of Mar, 2018 how well browsers support the text." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>One place you can go is this site www.html5accessibility.com. And what
you&#39;ll find at this site is how well the different browsers are
supporting the text. So you can see right now, Edge actually has 100%
compliance which isn&#39;t surprising because it&#39;s one of the newest
browsers, so they had accesibility in mind right from the beginning. The
other browsers were created before people were paying quite as much
attention, so they are definitely making strides to get better and
better. However, it is important to notice that Internet Explorer is at
56% and since it&#39;s been basically relegated into the background, it&#39;s
unlikely that it&#39;s going to get much better. Greed and arrogance kept
Microsoft behind.</p>

  alt="Review 1.04 Looking at Your Browser Options." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So what I want you to take away from this is that browsers can vary in
how well they adhere to different standards. And different versions of
browsers also need to be considered as well. Just because something
didn&#39;t work in 2018, doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work in 2019. So the best
thing that you can do is write your code, and then open it up in Safari,
and Firefox, and Chrome, as many different browsers as you can. Just not
IE unless you have a shit load of extra time to re-write everything. Not
only will it make your site better, but it will be a little bit
interesting for you as you can look at the different ways that HTML5 is
supported.</p>

<h2 id="ch1-05">1.05 How to Use an Editor to Create an HTML File (10:11)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 57. how to use an editor to create an html file (1.05) (41) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="1.05 How to Use an Editor to Create an HTML File." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

One of the things that you&#39;re going to learn about making your web pages
is that once in a while, you have to bite the bullet and stop listening
to me and start creating things on your own. Until now, we&#39;ve talked
about browsers and how you can look at webpages but when it comes time
to create a webpage, we have to use a different type of software called
an editor. Before we begin typing in your code though, it is always
worth your time to organize yourself and organize your files.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 58. creating and editing your files (42) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image058.png" 
  title="Creating and Editing Your Files" 
  alt="Creating and Editing Your Files." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p><b>Step</b> 1, you need to decide where on your computer you&#39;re going
to save your HTML files. I highly recommend that you make your own
folder called HTML, maybe HTML week 1, week 2, but something so that you
can find your code.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b>, you need to come up with a naming convention. This is
a fancy way of saying name your file something that you&#39;re going to
remember. Usually in class I end up with like 18 different files that
all say page 1, page 2, page 3, and that&#39;s not really helpful for me
figuring out what&#39;s inside the page. So when you come up with your
names, it&#39;s usually a good idea to have two-word names such as your
Intro Page, Favorite Restaurants, Summer Pictures. When you use two
names though, you can&#39;t leave spaces between the names, so you&#39;ll often
add a dash between it or use something called camelCase, where you use
lowercase for the first word and uppercase for the second name to have
that little hump as if you&#39;re a camel. But again, it&#39;s very important
that you do not use spaces and that you&#39;re very consistent with your
capitalization. Computers don&#39;t like it when you aren&#39;t consistent.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b>, you need to do is decide on an editor. If you&#39;re using
Windows, you might be tempted to use Notepad because it&#39;s a built in
editor that you can find easily. But it wasn’t conducive to creating
webpages. Instead, I would recommend Notepad++, Sublime or VS Code, also
called Visual Studio Code. In the same way, on a Mac, you can always
find a software editor called TextEdit. But again, it doesn&#39;t have the
cool tips and tricks that you can use to make a webpage, so instead, I
would recommend TextWrangler, Sublime, or again, VS Code. All of these
editors are free, but some of them, you might have to take that extra
step to download and put on your computer.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a paid learner on the Coursera platform, you do have access to
VS Code right here within the site. But if you&#39;re one of our non-paid
learners, don&#39;t worry, you can still do everything we do. You just have
to download it first.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve decided on your editor, you&#39;re going to open it up and
then I&#39;m going to want you to save your file and when you go to save it,
don&#39;t forget to put it in a nicely named folder so you can find it
later.</p>

<p>The next step is to add three parts to a page. The <b>Doctype</b>, which
says, hey, I&#39;m going to use HTML5. The <b>head</b> section of your page,
which is usually where you put your title so people can see it on the
top and then any tags or content you want in the <b>body</b>. Save
often, every time you type in a few lines, hit that Control-S or
Command-S. It&#39;s a shortcut for saving your file. Then when you&#39;re all
done, you have your code in your editor but you want to open up your
page in your browser so you can see all the cool stuff that you&#39;ve made.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 60/61. new folder; wd4e using visual studio code (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Create wd4e.html within folder; WD4E" 
  alt="Create wd4e.html within folder; WD4E." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />

<p>Let&#39;s try this together using Visual Studio Code. The first thing that
I&#39;m going to do is make a folder called &quot;<b>WD4E</b>.&quot; I&#39;m going to
right- click and click on &quot;New Folder&quot; or you can also go to &quot;File,&quot;
&quot;New Folder,&quot; and I&#39;m going to name it as I mentioned, just something
I&#39;ll remember, <b>WD4E</b>, and maybe add an HTML because we&#39;re going to
do a lot of coding together. So now I have my folder where I want to
keep my files. I&#39;ve opened up Visual Studio Code and don&#39;t be scared off
by all these different options. Focus in on the one option that says
&quot;New File&quot; and we want to use a regular old text file.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 62. create myfirstpage.html (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image062.png" 
  title="Create myFirstPage.html for testing" 
  alt="Create myFirstPage.html for testing." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to close this window over here and remember I said one of the
first things we want to do is we want to save this file, so for the
first time, I welcome you to go to &quot;File&quot; and then &quot;Save As.&quot; I&#39;m going
to call this, <b>myFirstPage.html</b>. If you notice, it has in my
<b>WD4E</b> folder, that&#39;s very important. We want to make sure it&#39;s in
there. I&#39;m going to hit &#39;&#39;Save.&#39;&#39;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 63. add title to myfirstpage.html (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Add a title to myFirstPage.html" 
  alt="Add a title to myFirstPage.html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Our next step is very tricky and exciting and makes you feel like a real
coder, even though we haven&#39;t done any coding before. Because I told
Visual Studio Code that this is an HTML file, do you see up there? I am
able to do exclamation point, Tab. It fills in all this crazy HTML stuff
that we might not know how to use. The important part to notice is that
I&#39;ve included <b>DOCTYPE</b> html. There&#39;s a title in here. I think I&#39;ll
change this title to, &quot;My First Page.&quot; There&#39;s a body tag where I&#39;m just
going to say, &quot;Hi from Colleen.&quot; If I look up here near the top, I can
see there&#39;s a little circle next to my file name. If you see a circle,
that means I haven&#39;t saved it recently. I am going to do a Command-S to
save it. Now I&#39;ve made my first page. Yay!</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 64. exclamation & tab to load html (45) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image064.png" 
  title="Enter exclamation point, then tab to load initial HTML code" 
  alt="Enter exclamation point, then tab to load initial HTML code." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>But I need that last step (#5). That last step is how do you go from
looking at something as an editor to actually seeing it in your browser.
And that&#39;s where it&#39;s so important to make sure that you remember where
you saved your file. I&#39;m going to open up my folder, make this a little
bigger for you. I&#39;m going to click on &quot;myFirstPage.html&quot;. As you can
see, I get the, Oh, so exciting page that says &quot;Hi from Colleen.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the reasons a lot of people give up on coding early on is that
there&#39;s actually a lot of ways and places that things can go wrong.
Let&#39;s learn how to go on and search for things. But I would really like
to try to prepare you to know, there are some things that you&#39;re going
to do and everyone does it, so it&#39;s okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 65. troubleshooting; right-click open (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image065.png" 
  title="Troubleshooting; right-click, open as .html" 
  alt="Troubleshooting; right-click, open as .html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The first thing that happens to many people is that when they click on
their file, instead of opening up in Chrome or Safari, or Firefox, it
opens back up in Sublime or TextEdit. It opens up in the editor. If that
happens to you, you&#39;re going to want to right-click on your file and
select &#39;&#39;Open With,&#39;&#39; and then you can pick up a browser.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you open your page, instead of seeing the content that you are hoping,
you actually see all that ugly HTML code and you can&#39;t figure out why
it&#39;s showing you that text rather than the pretty page. If that&#39;s the
case, usually the problem is that your file extension, you forgot to
save it as .html. You&#39;re going to want to go back and check that.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 66. troubleshooting; refresh with f5, verify name (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image066.png" 
  title="Troubleshooting; refresh with f5 and verify name/extension" 
  alt="Troubleshooting; refresh with f5 and verify name/extension." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Another problem that can happen is you can change your code. But even
after you&#39;ve changed it, so that instead of saying, &quot;Hi from Colleen,&quot;
maybe you want to say, &quot;Hi from Catherine,&quot; &quot;Hi from Sochi.&quot; You change
it and nothing happens. Just because you change your HTML file in your
editor and you&#39;ve saved it, you still need to go in and tell your
browser, Hey, I have a new version and that&#39;s called refreshing your
browser. You can either go back up to the top and hit the &quot;Refresh&quot;
button, or you can try to use something called a shortcut, which is to
just type in Command or <b>Control-R.</b></p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t forget to verify
your file name. Sometimes we think we&#39;re opening one file, but we&#39;re
actually opening a different one. Another problem that people often get
is they get what we call like weird characters. Things that don&#39;t look
like English. That happens most often when people copy and paste code
from a PowerPoint or Google Slide, instead of typing them by hand. They
pick up these hidden characters. Try those things if it&#39;s not working
for you, try refreshing the page, try going back, and making sure you
saved your file. And if you copied and pasted, try to go back in and
type it in by hand.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 67. examples; textedit, sublime, vs code & replit (47) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image067.png" 
  title="Examples; TextEdit, Sublime, VS Code and Replit" 
  alt="Examples; TextEdit, Sublime, VS Code and Replit." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Throughout the rest of this course, you will see examples that I have
written in TextEdit, in Sublime, in VS Code, and something new for the
latest version of this class is something called Replit. TextEdit, as I
mentioned, is built in. Sometimes people like to use that. But it really
leads to a lot of problems that first-time coders just shouldn&#39;t be
bothering with. Sublime is a free option for editors where you can
download it and it&#39;ll give you lots of nice tips and tools very similar
to VS Code.</p>

<p>Replit, however, is going to be something that I encourage all of you to
use. Because Replit not only let you edit your code it&#39;s also going to
let you share your code with your friends and family all across the
country and all across the world. But wherever you feel most
comfortable, pick one, maybe two editors. And that&#39;s what you&#39;re going
to want to focus on and really become a pro.</p>

  alt="1.06 How to Use VS Code." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s talk about how to use Visual Studio code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 69. vs code welcome screen (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image069.png" 
  title="VS Code Welcome screen" 
  alt="VS Code Welcome screen."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Once you open up Visual Studio Code, it&#39;s not unusual to be overwhelmed
at first as to what you should be doing. Particularly since when we
think of webpages, we like to think of a web page is being one-page. But
actually a web page is numerous files that are all put together.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 70. vs code, open folder (49) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image070.png"
  title="VS Code, open folder" 
  alt="VS Code, open folder." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>My recommendation for you is once you start Visual Studio Code to always
click on &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Open Folder,&quot; and navigate to the folder that you
created for your site. In this case, it&#39;s &quot;wd4e-html.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 71. vs code, explorer screen (49) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image071.png" 
  title="VS Code, Explorer screen"
  alt="VS Code, Explorer screen."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The reason that you want to open an entire folder, and I&#39;m going to say,
yes, I trust the authors because it&#39;s me, is because off here to the
left, there is something called the Explorer that will list all the
different files you have, which right now isn&#39;t that many. But when you
create sites that include images or CSS, or even a site that has three
or four pages, having this outline is going to let you link them
together. Let&#39;s start off by making a simple file. I&#39;m going to do new
text file. I won&#39;t do anything fancy this time. I&#39;m just going to do a
command-S and I&#39;m going to call this &quot;firstPage.html.&quot; I&#39;m going to add
some of the code that we talked about when we make a page which is
DOCTYPE.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to stop for just a second, and point out that Visual Studio
Code has already figured out what I&#39;m trying to type in. They even
realize that I have a typo and that I forgot that first initial
exclamation point. I&#39;m going to hit &quot;Tab&quot; and it finishes the DOCTYPE
for me. I&#39;m going to add my HTML tag and as I finished, it added the
closing tag. I&#39;m going to add my head. I&#39;m going to add a title. Let&#39;s
call it, &quot;My Amazing First Page.&quot; You know what, did you notice I&#39;m
running out of space. Let&#39;s resize this a little bit, so we can have as
much room as we want. My First Page. Then I&#39;m going to add a body tag,
where I will again just say, &quot;My first page looks great.&quot;</p>

<p>In an earlier lesson, I mentioned the importance of saving your work as
you go along, which I&#39;m going to do right now. Again, you can either use
&quot;File,&quot; &quot;Save&quot; or you can do the shortcut (ctrl-S). But once you look at
your code, it&#39;s really important to make sure that you&#39;re always taking
a moment to see what it looks like as well. One option for doing that is
to go to your folder, find your first page and when we click on it, it
opens up in Google Chrome.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 72. firstpage with title (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image072.png" 
  title="firstPage.html with title" 
  alt="firstPage.html with title." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to zoom in so you can see it a little bit better. You can see
I have a title up here of, &quot;My Amazing First Page.&quot; Let&#39;s say I want to
go back and say, maybe my first page looks maybe not great, it just
looks okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 73/74. firstpage.html (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image073.png"

<img src="./images/image074.png" 
  title="My first page looks okay" 
  alt="My first page looks okay." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />

<p>Because we&#39;re new, we have ways to improve. I&#39;m going to save it. But
when I go back over here, it still looks the same as it did last time.
If you remember, changing something in the editor doesn&#39;t automatically
tell your browser to reload it. I&#39;m going to click here on the &quot;Reload,&quot;
and it now it says, &quot;My first page looks okay.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 75. firstpage with title, head, body (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image075.png"

  alt="firstPage.html in wd4e-html, with title, head, and body." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Personally, when I code, I like to have half my screen as the browser,
and half my screen as text editor, so I can go back and forth and see
both. I&#39;m also going to go in here and add one more. &quot;I am adding
another line.&quot; I&#39;m going to do &quot;Save,&quot; and I&#39;m going to do &quot;Reload.&quot; One of the things you might notice is how things look in the editor is not
always how it&#39;s going to look on the webpage, will learn how to fix
that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 76. vs code, add live server for testing (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image076.png" 
  title="VS Code, add Live Server for testing purposes" 
  alt="VS Code, add Live Server for testing purposes." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>But I want to show you one more tip just in case you feel like Visual
Studio Code is the editor you want to use. I&#39;m going to click back on
Visual Studio Code. I&#39;m going to go the left-hand side, make a little
bit smaller and go down to where I can find something called
&quot;Extensions.&quot; If you go to &quot;Extensions,&quot; you will find something called
&quot;Live server.&quot; That right there, &quot;Live server&quot; by Ritwick Dey, install
it. You can feel pretty good when you see something has 33.9 million
downloads. I&#39;m going to install it. I only have to do this once. That&#39;s
it. I never have to do this again. As it installs, let me explain what
Live Server does. Live server will let you see the changes you make as
you type. I&#39;m going to close this up here. I&#39;m going to make sure that I
can see both things on the same page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 77. html code & browser test screen (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image077.png" 
  title="firstPage.html in wd4e.html and browser test screen" 
  alt="firstPage.html in wd4e.html and browser test screen." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Now that I have Live server, I&#39;m going to go down here to the bottom
of the screen where it says &quot;go live&quot; at the very bottom. Now, every
time I make a change, let&#39;s go back and say, &quot;My page looks,&quot; we&#39;ll go
back to, &quot;amazing.&quot; Watch carefully, I&#39;m about to hit Save. As I hit
Save, it automatically showed on the other page. I could change my, um,
I&#39;m going to just to give you a sense, because Visual Studio Code is
pretty cool. I&#39;m going to type in just a little bit of Latin and when I
do, it fills it all in for me.</p>

<p>So, when you use Visual Studio Code, the most important thing is to
open it up and use proper naming conventions. If you would like, you can
install &quot;Live Server&quot; and then from there we will go and learn how to
add multiple files, multiple images, and lots of things that is going to
make your webpage look amazing.</p>

<h3>1.06 Editors: How to use VS Code</h3>

<p>We highly recommend using <a href="https://replit.com/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replit</a>
but Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular editor that you may want to
use as well – especially if you need to code without access to the
Internet.</p>

<p>Some of the reasons people use VSCode are:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>It’s free</p></li>
  <li><p>It works on all of the major operations systems (Linux, Mac, and Windows)</p></li>
  <li><p>It color-codes your file for easier debugging</p></li>
  <li><p>It provides hover-over definitions, tips, and suggestions for any language.</p></li>
  <li><p>It provides numerous tools such as auto-complete and the ability to view changes 
    to your HTML page in real time.</p></li>
  <li><p>For advanced users you can link it to your Github site for sharing with 
    others.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to use VSCode you will probably need to download it to
your computer. Here is a trusted link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" 
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Visual Studio
Code - Mac, Linux, Windows</a></p>

<p>Once you have the software installed you can watch the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting
started with Visual Studio Code</a>.  Don’t worry that they start with
Python and JavaScript, they get to an HTML example about 5 minutes into
the video!   Make sure to focus on the parts of the video where you can
open files, and the portion where they show you how to use Live
Preview.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful tools in VSCode is IntelliSense – a feature
that fills in code for you.  For introductory students it can get
confusing if VSCode fills in the code that you were expecting.  So I
encourage you to validate all of your code with the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" 
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The W3C Markup Validation Service</a>
to ensure that you are writing syntactically correct code.</p>

  alt="1.07 How to Use Replit." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Earlier I mentioned that one of the editors I would highly recommend you
use in this course is called &quot;Replit,&quot; because I want to show you that
writing code is great. Writing code that you can share online to show
others your progress is also really exciting.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 79. online editors; replit (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image079.png"

  alt="Online editors; Replit." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>You&#39;ve probably used online editors before. Google Docs and Microsoft
365 are common ways to share your documents. You can type something in,
you can share it with your friends or your colleagues, and you can all
make updates.</p>

<p>Sharing code is a little bit different, especially when you want to
share your web page with someone. Do you want to share the code or do
you want to share more with them that visual thing that you created?
Today, we are going to use something called &quot;Replit.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80. integrated development environments (ides) (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image080.png" 
  title="Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); Replit" 
  alt="Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); Replit." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Replit is what we call an IDE, which is a fancy term called
Integrated Development Environment. It lets you write your code, run
your code, test your code, and share your code with others. Replit is an
IDE that was made for beginner programmers. It doesn&#39;t mean that the
first time you see it, you&#39;re going to be able to use it immediately but
it does mean that it is built for people like you and I who want to make
simple web pages and learn as we go along.</p>

<p>In this class, I will switch between using Replit and Sublime and
Visual Studio Code. However, when you submit your homework, I&#39;m going to
highly recommend you using Replit because as I mentioned, unlike Sublime
and Visual Studio Code, there are built-in tools for you to share your
web page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 81. create a replit account (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image081.png" 
  title="Create a Replit account" 
  alt="Create a Replit account." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The first step to using Replit is to create a Replit account. You&#39;re
going to want to create a username, provide your email and give them a
password. But wait, wait wait wait, just one moment before you create
that username, I want you to realize that the username you pick right
now is going to be part of that URL for your web page. So pick something
that&#39;s fun, representative view, or if you&#39;re hoping to make a site
perhaps for family members, friends, a company, pick a name that you
think that they would want to use as a front-facing part of their
company or personality.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re logged on, we&#39;re going to start off by creating a Repl.
I&#39;m going to click right down here on &quot;Create Repl&quot;. It&#39;ll give you a
number of different templates that you can use.</p>

<p>We will scroll down until we find HTML, CSS, and JS, which stands for
JavaScript. Don&#39;t worry that we don&#39;t know any CSS or JS yet. We can go
ahead and click on here.</p>

<p>The next step is to give our site a title. I&#39;m probably not going to
use AnguishedConcreteShockwave as they&#39;re recommending. Instead, I&#39;m
going to go ahead and use &quot;MyFirstPage.&quot; As a reminder, I&#39;m doing that
&quot;MyFirstPage,&quot; in fact, I&#39;m going to do it the right way and make &quot;my&quot;
lower case, the F capitalized, and the P capitalized. That&#39;s what we
call camelCase. Anyone can see it, and I&#39;m going to click on &quot;Create
Repl&quot;.</p>

<p>The first few times you log on, you&#39;re probably going to see a lot of
helpful tips. I would recommend that you click through on all the next.
However, for me, I&#39;ve seen this before, so I don&#39;t really need to go
through it. If you look, you will see that Repl has provided a lot of
scaffolding for us, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s gone in and it&#39;s given us a lot of code. It&#39;s provided that DOCTYPE
HTML. It has a title for us, it&#39;s called &quot;Replit&quot; so I might change that
to again, &quot;My First Page&quot; or something along that line. It&#39;s linked to
something called a style sheet that we&#39;re not using yet so I&#39;m going to
delete that. Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. It has &quot;Hello world&quot; and
then it has a whole bunch of JavaScript. I&#39;m just going to get rid of
that too. There&#39;s no point overwhelming ourselves with code we don&#39;t
need but I am going to say instead of &quot;Hello world,&quot; I&#39;m going to type
in &quot;Hello Colleen&quot; and I&#39;m going to do a command-S (ctrl-S) for save.</p>

<p>Did you notice something off here to the right? It will automatically
show us what our page is going to look like as we type and save things.
I could change this from &quot;Hello Colleen&quot; to &quot;Hello Bacon&quot; as you will
all get to know, it&#39;s my very cute dog. &quot;How are you today?&quot; I&#39;m going
to hit &quot;Save&quot; again. Again for save, I&#39;m going to do a command S. This
is a really great part about being able to write my code, test my code,
and see my code.</p>

<p>I want you to look and take the time to really check out Repl and see
that you can see like, oh, I even have a real web page here. My web page
is <a href="https://myfirstpage.wd4ehtml.repl.co" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Notice that it deleted my
CamelCase. It made it all lower case. The reason for that is because
when you&#39;re typing in a URL, what&#39;s the chance that someone&#39;s actually
going to remember to make some of them upper case and some of them lower
case? You&#39;ll create files, you&#39;ll edit your files. While you edit them,
you&#39;ll be able to see what they look like. This is why I&#39;m recommending
you use Replit.</p>

<h3>1.07 Editors: How to use Replit</h3>

<p>Replit is what we call an Integrated Development Environment – this
is a fancy term software that lets you do more than just edit your
files. In this case Replit lets you create a page AND host it so that
other people can see what you have created.</p>

<p>Replit is free, and the first step is to make an account.</p>

<h3>1.07 Getting started</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Go to <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
    class="uri">https://replit.com/</a></p></li>
  <li><p>Select sign up</p></li>
  <li><p>Create a username, provide an email, and create a password</p></li>
  <li><p>At any time if you are asked to answer the optional questions (programming 
    ability, light/dark mode, usage) you can skip them</p></li>
  <li><p>Go to the email inbox you created your account with and verify your email</p></li>

<h4>Congrats!</h4>

<p>A tutorial will pop up and I encourage you to look through it to find
out what the different parts of the IDE are. But for now the important
thing is that you should be able to find three things: the Files
section, the Coding Environment, and the View window.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 90. the files section (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image090.png" 
  title="The Files Section"
  alt="The Files Section." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:30%" />

<h3>1.07 File Section</h3>

<p>The file section is located on the top left corner of the screen.
This is where you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>View all your files and file structure</p></li>
  <li><p>Create new files by selecting the new file button in the upper
    right side of the file section. Name this new file and remember to use
	the correct file extension (.html, .css, .js) – Replit will create a
	template based on this extension.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create new folders by selecting the new folder button and naming
    your new folder</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>1.07 Coding Environment</h3>

<p>The coding environment is located in the middle of the screen and is
where you can edit your code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<h3>1.07 View Window</h3>

<p>As you make changes you can click the run button and Replit will
display your index.html file in the Webview area on the right hand side
of the screen. This is also where you can find the URL to share your
site - it will be a combination of your username and the project name
you chose when you created your repl.</p>

<h3>1.07 Additional Resources</h3>

<p>Here are some optional resources for you to explore if you are
interested in learning more about the topics from this week.</p>

<h3>1.07 The origins of MOSAIC</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c8iWUh3Sv4&amp;app=desktop" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview with Joseph Hardin.</a> 
If you are interested in learning more about the people who developed Mosaic, 
here is an interview with Joseph Hardin. The material in this video is just 
meant as a supplemental resource and is not required for the quizzes or any 
other evaluation.</p>

<h3>1.07 Readings</h3>

<p>The readings come from <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn to Code HTML &amp;
CSS: Develop &amp; Style Websites</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>Some students prefer to do the readings before the lecture videos -
they find it easier to listen when they recognize some of the words I am
using. Some students prefer to do the readings after the lectures so
that as they read they can connect it with what I said. Personally, I
would suggest that you do the readings before <b>AND</b> after the
lectures.</p>

<p>But no matter which method you chose, <b>make sure you do the
readings before the quiz</b>. They go into more detail than my lectures
and many of the quiz questions come directly from the readings. Also,
make sure not to read the entire lessons for 8. They go into CSS which
we are not covering in this course. (CSS is the next course in this
series.)</p>

<h2 id="ch2-01">2.01 The Document Object Model (DOM) (9:58)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 93. the document object model (dom) 2.01 (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image093.png" 
  title="2.01 The Document Object Model (DOM)" 
  alt="2.01 The Document Object Model (DOM)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s talk about writing clean code. When I&#39;m talking about clean code
I&#39;m talking about learning how to write code that&#39;s going to work on as
many devices as possible.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 94. the document object model (dom) (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image094.png" 
  title="The Document Object Model (DOM)" 
  alt="The Document Object Model (DOM)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In order to do that, you need to know a little bit about the Document Object 
Model, also called the DOM. When HTML5 was developed the main kind of driving 
goal is that they want to stick by the standard. That any new features should 
be based on HTML, CSS, the <b>DOM</b>, and JavaScript, and you can have a chance 
to learn about each one of those. But I want to talk about the <b>DOM</b> for 
just a little bit because it&#39;s going to help you understand the HTML a 
little bit better.</p>

<p>One of the things about geeky computer scientists like myself is that
we love trees. Not like trees out outside that are green and beautiful
in the fall. We like mathematical trees. These tree-like structures that
we can prove to be valid or invalid.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 95. tree structure; html is built on the dom (66) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image095.png" 
  title="HTTML is built on the DOM" 
  alt="HTTML is built on the DOM." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>When we talk about HTML as a tree we&#39;re talking about this idea that
at the very root of the tree we are going to be creating HTML. Then,
from that tree when we say, &quot;I&#39;m going to make an HTML document.&quot; We
want two parts. We want the head (on the left), and we want the body
(the right of the root element).</p>

<p>In the head we&#39;re going to keep all that kind of information that the
user isn&#39;t going to see for the most part. The one difference is we
might talk about the title, but we&#39;re going to have all of that kind of
hidden stuff nobody really cares about.</p>

<p>In the body is where we&#39;re going to learn to put all of our HTML5 tags.
So let&#39;s talk about HTML as a tree. In this case I&#39;m showing you this
idea that at the root of every HTML page should be what&#39;s called the
HTML tag. That kind of thing that says, lets the browser know, I&#39;m going
to be giving you certain types of tags and here&#39;s how I want them to
work.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~ 96. three parts of a well-formed document; doctype, head & body (67) ~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image096.png" 
  title="Three parts of a well-formed document; Doctype, Head and Body" 
  alt="Three parts of a well-formed document; Doctype, Head and Body." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>If we don&#39;t look at it as a picture, I can also kind of just tell you
that every tree has three parts to a well-formed document. The
<b>Doctype</b>, which is the version of HTML that you&#39;re going to be
using. The <b>head</b>, which is all of the metadata or kind of extra
information, and the body. The <b>body</b> is the displayable content.
The thing that most people are going to get back when they do the
<b>request-response cycle</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 97. doctype html (67) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image097.png" 
  title="Doctype html" 
  alt="Doctype html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So let&#39;s talk <b>doctype</b>. You are so lucky. When I was creating web
pages at first and we were in HTML4, we had to come up with all these
different ways to kind of explain whether our HTML4 was like very strict
standards or whether it was transitional. In HTML5, it&#39;s very simple to
say, &quot;Nope, there&#39;s only one thing and it&#39;s called DOCTYPE HTML, and
you&#39;re all set.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 98. head meta-data & title (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image098.png"
  title="Head meta-data and title"
  alt="Head meta-data and title."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>For the <b>head</b> which is inside the <b>head</b> tag, we&#39;re going
to have all this additional information used by the browser. For
instance, you might want to say what language you&#39;re creating your page
in. You could also include, and you really want to include, what the
title of your pages. When I am talking about the title I&#39;m not talking
about big kind of header that you see. I&#39;m talking about the little tiny
thing you see in the tab of your browser.</p>

<p>Later, you might want to add supporting files as well. You might want to
have CSS files that will style your page, or JavaScript that can add on
different interaction, or really any type of add-on that&#39;s going to
change the way people view and interact with your site. Other than the
title, the metadata is not displayed, people will not see it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 99. body (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image099.png" 
  title="Body" 
  alt="Body" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>What people do see is the information that&#39;s in your <b>body</b> tag.
That <b>body</b> tag is the bulk of your page. It&#39;s very important to
write well formatted or tree-like code where you&#39;re making sure that
every tag has an end. That you&#39;re not putting tags in weird orders. Most
of the content in the <b>body</b> is displayed by the browser but every
once in a while there&#39;s a little bit of metadata in there too. But we&#39;re
not going to hit that in this class.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 100. example, template.html (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image100.png" 
  title="Example, template.html" 
  alt="Example, template.html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let&#39;s look at an example. Right here, I have a file called
&quot;template.html,&quot; and I&#39;m displaying the code here on the screen for you.
Can you find the three parts of a well-formed document?</p>

<p>The first thing you want to look for is the <b>Doctype</b>. We&#39;ve got
that right here. Letting you know that this is an HTML5 document.</p>

<p>We then have the <b>HTML</b> tag which was the root of our really
scientific tree, and I&#39;m letting people know I&#39;d liked the language that
it&#39;s displayed in to be English.</p>

<p>In the <b>head</b> section we&#39;ve got that <b>metadata</b>. Where it&#39;s
telling us things like, &quot;Hey, I know that there&#39;s lots of different
keyboards and ways across the world to represent letters. I want you to
use what&#39;s called UTF-8.&quot; Don&#39;t worry that just use it every time.</p>

<p>Then the next part of my <b>metadata</b> is the <b>title</b> where we
want to see it saying, &quot;My First Page.&quot; That&#39;s it. That&#39;s two of the
three parts.</p>

<p>The last part is the <b>body</b> tag and it&#39;s displaying the content
that we want to see on the screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 101. browser display template.html (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image101.png" 
  title="Browser display template.html" 
  alt="Browser display template.html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>So let&#39;s look at this in a browser. What do I have? I have my
<b>title</b> way up here, and my displayable content right down there. I
have written the code, the next step you should always do is validate
the code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 102. validate the code with validator.w3.org (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image102.png" 
  title="Validate the Code with validator.w3.org" 
  alt="Validate the Code with validator.w3.org." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Say, &quot;Ok, I have written code it looks good, but I know that browsers
are very nice and they make things display nicely even when I haven&#39;t
written good code.&quot; So if you go to <b>validator.w3.org</b>, you can
check any website to see if the code is valid and you have three
choices. You can upload the <b>URL</b>, you can upload a <b>file</b>, or
you can actually <b>copy and paste your code</b> and put it right in
there. In this case, I&#39;ve put in the <b>URL</b> to <b>template.html</b>.
Run Check, and yay, not surprisingly because I knew I was going to be
taping this, it successfully checked. Don&#39;t worry about warnings.
Warnings are usually in to cover themselves.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 103. validator.w3.org options (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image103.png" 
  title="validator.w3.org options" 
  alt="validator.w3.org options." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>What if you want to validate your file but your files aren&#39;t actually on
the Internet yet? Let&#39;s walk through really quickly an example of how
you can do that. Let&#39;s say that I have my file &quot;template.html&quot; and I
want to check it. I want to point out to you that I went in and I
changed the file and I put in an intentional typo. I spelled the closing
tag for title incorrectly.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 104. validate by direct input & click 'check' (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image104.png" 
  title="Validate by direct input, then click &#39;check&#39;" 
  alt="Validate by direct input, then click &#39;check&#39;." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let&#39;s see what happens. And if the browser or the validator can find
this. What I&#39;m going to do is I went to <b>validator.w3.org</b>, and I&#39;m
now going to select the third option, &quot;validate by direct input.&quot; I go
back to my file, command A or control A, if you&#39;re on a PC, Command C, I
copied all the code and now I want to put it in the validator. Hit
&quot;check,&quot; up, and if we scroll down you can see that I did get two
errors.</p>

<p>Why did I get two errors when I only typed one error in? Well,
validators are never perfect. So what error it found is it said, &quot;Uh oh.
I found the end of a file and I was not expecting that.&quot; Well the reason
that happened is let&#39;s check out error number 2, it tells us, &quot;Oh you
forgot to close the title tag.&quot; So sometimes one error can cause a lot
of error messages.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 105. check again, no errors or warnings (72) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image105.png" 
  title="Check again, no errors or warnings" 
  alt="Check again, no errors or warnings." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to go back over to my code, I&#39;m going to fix it and put that
title in and save it. Copy it again, put it in and I&#39;m going to check
again. This time, checking complete, no errors.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 106. review the 'dom' (72) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image106.png" 
  title="Review the &#39;Document Object Model&#39; (DOM)" 
  alt="Review the &#39;Document Object Model&#39; (DOM)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Just to review, you really want to follow <b>DOM</b> structure if you
want a well-formed page. Following that structure means you always use
beginning and end tags. Also, you close inner tags before outer ones.
What that means is if you start a title tag you&#39;ve got to end it before
you end the body tag.</p>

<p>You also will want to use valid attributes which is one of the things
we&#39;re going to talk about a little later when we talk about images and
basically parts of your page that need extra information. The problem
with browsers is that they&#39;ll actually fix bad code for you. I always
call them the helicopter parents of coding. It&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, I know what
you wanted it to look like so, that&#39;s the way I&#39;m going to make it look
on the screen.&quot; The problem is that doesn&#39;t always work for everyone.
So, just because your site looks good to you when you&#39;re looking at it
on your browser, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right. You have to use a validator to
check your code.</p>

<h3>2.01 HTML5 Tags and Syntax</h3>

<p>At first it will seem like the number of tags is overwhelming, but
you can really start by focusing on the most common. These tags

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 107. html5 tags and syntax (74) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image107.png" 
  title="2.02 HTML5 Tags and Syntax" 
  alt="2.02 HTML5 Tags and Syntax." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />


<p>This is it. Today&#39;s the day, I&#39;m finally going to teach you enough HTML
that you can start making an interesting page to share with your friends
and family. It&#39;s also, unfortunately, probably, or at least hopefully,
my first really big disappointment to you.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 108. html tags (74) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image108.png" 
  title="HTML tags" 
  alt="HTML tags." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>And the reason is, I need to just break it to you right away that I
can&#39;t teach you all of the HTML5 tags. I can&#39;t teach them all to you and
you don&#39;t want me to teach you all the tags. It would be incredibly
boring for me to list them all off to you. Instead, I&#39;m gonna get you
started and point you in the direction of where you can find resources
for more tags. Because it&#39;s really not until you need a tag that you
ever really bother learning about it.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 109. example, img tag attributes (75) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image109.png" 
  title="Example, img tag attributes" 
  alt="Example, img tag attributes." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Every tag has a beginning and an end. So, right here I&#39;m using what&#39;s
called an h1 tag or a heading tag to encase the words &quot;Hello World.&quot; The
first h1 is my start tag. It just shows the simple tag that I want
inside brackets. The second tag, the closing tag, always starts with a
slash. The indicates to the browser, she&#39;s about to end a tag. This is
one of the most common, is to have the start tag and the closing tag,
with some sort of text inside of it.</p>

<p>My next tag, or the image tag, is what&#39;s called a self-closing tag.
There&#39;s only one tag, and it contains both the beginning and the end. In
this case, as soon as the browser sees the image tag, it knows that
you&#39;re gonna give it information that it can use to create a picture.
And since there&#39;s no real text associated with the image, at least at
this point, or any that you want to show on this screen, it&#39;s going to
close itself. So, while every tag has a beginning and an end, some do
close differently.</p>

Also, some tags have what we call attributes. So the source which is
where the picture is located, an href which is where the new page you
want to go to is. So when we talk about the tags, for some of them I&#39;ll
also be talking about the attributes.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 110. display types: block & inline (76) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image110.png" 
  title="Display types: block and inline" 
  alt="Display types: block and inline." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Before we begin, I want to talk to you about one of the most important
attributes in an element and that&#39;s its <b>display</b>. The two most
common display types are what are called <b>block</b> and <b>inline</b>.
<b>Block tags</b> are ones that take up a certain amount of width and
height. So anytime you have a tag that&#39;s called <b>block</b>, it&#39;s the
same thing as if when you were typing, you hit new line at the end, or
enter, or return. <b>Inline tags</b> are ones that only take up as much
space as is needed. I&#39;m gonna show you examples of both, but I really
want you to understand some tags are <b>block</b> and some are
<b>inline</b>. And it may not seem important now, but it&#39;s the kind of
thing that&#39;s going to make it much easier for you when you&#39;re trying to
make your pages look a certain way.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 111. common tags: heading, paragraph & divs (all block) (76) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image111.png" 
  title="Common Tags: Heading, paragraph &amp; divs (all block)" 
  alt="Common Tags: Heading, paragraph &amp; divs (all block)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Some of the most common tags, include the ones I&#39;m about to tell you
about. Headings are <b>block</b> tags. You have <b>h1, h2, h3</b>, all
the way down to <b>h6</b>. These tags have what are both called syntax
and semantics. To the browser, at first sight, it might simply mean,
&quot;hey, everything that&#39;s in an <b>h1</b> tag, I want to make it really
big and bold.&quot; And things that are <b>h6</b>, &quot;I also wanna make them
slightly bigger and bolder, but not nearly big and bold as the ones of
the lower numbers.&quot;</p>

<p>What a lot of people do is they just randomly throw around <b>h3</b>
tags or <b>h4</b> tags just because they like the look that the text
takes on it. But these tags also have semantics, meaning that you don&#39;t
see when you just look at it, and the semantics are, things that are in
an h1 tag have much higher importance than things that are in an
<b>h5</b> or <b>h6</b>. And this is very important for people who are
using screen readers. If you start throwing <b>h3</b> tags and <b>h2</b>
tags all over the place just because you want them to be a little bit
bigger and bolder, it&#39;s gonna be very confusing.</p>

<p>Another extremely common tag is the paragraph tag. It&#39;s also
<b>block</b>, and inside of it you can only contain other inline
elements. So you can put a lot of text, a lot of pictures and things
like that, but you should never put a paragraph inside of a paragraph or
even, you should never put a heading inside of a paragraph.</p>

<p>Another common tag is the <b>div</b> tag. This is a generic section that
tends to be larger than a paragraph, and it&#39;s related content that you
would like to group together. <b>Divs</b> used to be the most popular
tag. You would use the <b>div</b> for everything. The problem with divs
is that there&#39;s really no semantic meaning behind a <b>div</b>. If you
put a lot of them to your page you&#39;re not giving your readers or users
any extra information to let them know that this is a footer or a header
or something along those lines.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 112. more tags: ol, ul, and br (78) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image112.png" 
  title="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break" 
  alt="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Two additional tags that you&#39;ll find you&#39;ll use a lot are the list
tags. If you put in the tag <b>&lt;ol&gt;</b> that stands for an ordered
list. By default it&#39;s going to put each list item as one, two, three,
etc. You need to make sure that you end each of your list items before
you start the next one. And you need to make sure that you&#39;ve ended all
your list items before you end your ordered list.</p>

<p>The unordered list is very similar, only instead of using numbers,
you&#39;ll use special symbols, perhaps the circle, or the small square,
depending upon your browser. Now, later when we talk about attributes,
I&#39;ll mention that you can go ahead and change your ordered list. So
instead of being regular numbers, you&#39;re using Roman numerals, or
uppercase letters, or lowercase letters. But by default, these are just
going to either be a one, two, three, four, etc., or some sort of little
disc.</p>

<p>Finally one more tag that I know you&#39;re gonna see a lot of is the line
break tag. Line break is simply a <b>&lt;br&gt;</b>, stands for line
break, and this is a self-closing tag. Now one of the things that&#39;s very
important that I tell you is when you&#39;re typing your code you can put as
many line breaks in your code as you want. Enter, enter, enter, enter,
enter. But the browser ignores all of it. The browser is not going to
put something on a new line, unless it runs out of space or it
specifically sees the <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 113. attributes of elements (79) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image113.png" 
  title="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break" 
  alt="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I mentioned before with the lists that tags can have attributes.
Attributes provide additional information about an element. Sometimes
they&#39;re absolutely necessary, sometimes they&#39;re just supplemental. The
important thing to remember is that attributes are always, always
specified in the start tag, in the beginning, and attributes come in a
name value pair.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 114. images (inline) src and alt (79) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image114.png" 
  title="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break" 
  alt="More tags: Ordered List, Unordered List, and Line Break." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let&#39;s look at a tag that needs attributes in order to work. I&#39;m gonna
use the image tag as an example. Images are inline which means you can
actually put many images next to each other. And in order for an image
tag to work, you pretty much need to tell the computer what picture it
is you want it to show. So in this case, the source attribute that
indicates the browser that the picture you wanna show is called
&quot;myPicture.jpg.&quot;</p>

<p>Always notice that again it&#39;s a name value pair. So the name of the
attribute it sorts and the value always goes in double quotes, and in
this case is &quot;myPicture.jpg.&quot; Many people will just end right there, but
I don&#39;t want you to do that. Images should also always include an alt
attribute. Alt stands for alternative text, and this is what&#39;s going to
show up to somebody who&#39;s using a screen reader, or even if the picture
is missing for some reason, because you&#39;ve misnamed your file. This will
allow, if you have the little broken picture, some sort of text to show
up, to help people realize what it is you&#39;re trying to show. So in this
case, I have one tag, which you can tell because of the bracket, and two
attributes, source and alt.</p>

<p>Now peaking of images there&#39;s a few things I want to mention to you.
Images rarely work the first time you use them. They&#39;re either gonna
show a broken link because you wrote the wrong file name or you forgot
to upload it or it&#39;s not in the right file, or the picture is going to
be too big or too small or something like that. Unless you have the
broken link, and you&#39;re just worried about the appearance, I want you to
let it go for right now. What we care about right now is that you can
get tags to work. We&#39;re gonna worry about appearance later. So if you
really have your heart set on making things look a certain way, then
make sure that you open up the picture in some sort of editor and save
it to exactly the size you want. And give it a really good name. It&#39;s
very frustrating to work on your web page when all of your files are
named &quot;image_02586.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 115. more images, src, alt, title, class (80) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image115.png" 
  title="More images; src, alt, title, and class" 
  alt="More images; src, alt, title, and class." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Here&#39;s an example for you of one image tag with multiple attributes.
I have the image tag, followed by source, &quot;logo.jpg.&quot; I have the
alternative text, which is info for the screen readers and broken links.
I include a title attribute, which will often display when you hover
over the image, and then I also have a class attribute, which might
indicate extra formatting, such as the height, the width, the position,
etc.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~ 116. more attributes; class, id, style, accesskey & tabindex (81) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image116.png" 
  title="More attributes; class, id, style, accesskey &amp; tabindex" 
  alt="More attributes; class, id, style, accesskey &amp; tabindex." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>As you learn more and more tags, you&#39;re gonna learn that they have
specific attributes. It makes no sense for an image to also include some
sort of href. It makes no sense for a link to include other attributes.
But there are some that apply to many of the tags, so I just want to
mention them to you quickly and we&#39;ll come back to them later in the
class.</p>

<p>The first is, well, the class attribute. What is does is it applies
special properties to groups of elements. We&#39;ll use that later when we
want to say, &quot;hey, we want to style all these pictures perhaps as
thumbnails.&quot;</p>

<p>Ids specify a very unique id to just a single element on the page.
And you&#39;re gonna want to do this if you want to link back to it, if
later you wanna apply JavaScript to it. But ID says, &quot;hey this is a
special part of the page, you&#39;re not gonna find anything else like
it.&quot;</p>

<p>Style is an attribute that used to be very widely used. Style lets
you apply visual style. So you can put in special colors or spacing and
things like that.</p>

<div class="accesskey">
  <p>The next one is called <b>accesskey</b>, and an <b>accesskey</b> is very
  important for accessibility. It allows a shortcut key to activate, or
  put into focus, an element. Maybe you have a big page and you have a
  form on it, and you want someone to be able to quickly get to a certain
  part of your page. You can give them an <b>accesskey</b>.</p>
</div>

<div class="tabindex">
  <p>In the same way, some people may be accessing your page and only using
  the tab button to navigate through your page. If you do that, you&#39;re
  gonna wanna be careful about putting what&#39;s called a tabindex, and it
  lets you actually specify which order people get to different elements
  in your page. So even though something may come later in the page, if
  you feel it&#39;s really important you can put a high tabindex and they get
  there quicker.</p>
</div>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 117. special entities (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image117.png" 
  title="Special Entities" 
  alt="Special Entities." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Okay, so one of the things I told you is that all tags start with a
bracket. Which is fine, that&#39;s very easy to figure out, and the browser
knows whenever it sees a bracket, it shouldn&#39;t display the content, it
should do something fancy. So what do you do if you want the browser to
display a bracket? And say, &quot;hey, this isn&#39;t a start tag?&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 118. character display for special entities (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image118.png" 
  title="Charater display for special entities" 
  alt="Charater display for special entities." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Well, then you&#39;re gonna use special entities. So if you want a
bracket, then use <b>&quot;&lt;&quot;</b>. The lt stands for less than and please
note that&#39;s an L, not a one. You could also do <b>&quot;&gt;&quot;</b> for greater
than, <b>&quot;©&quot;</b>. If you&#39;d like extra blank spaces, you actually have to
use a special entity. Putting space, space, space, the browser ignores
it. You&#39;d have to actually put <b>&quot;&amp;nbsp&quot;</b>.</p>

<p>Again, if you want the cent, all right, well what if you actually
want an ampersand? Well, in that case we even have a special entity for
that, which is <b>&quot;&amp;&quot;.</b> So, we&#39;ve gone through a number of tags
today, and you&#39;re gonna learn more and more tags and probably use cheat
sheets and go online to find a bunch of different tags you wanna
use.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 119. review hmlt5 tags and syntax (83) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Review; difference between tag &amp; attribute, how to end a self-closing tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>An important thing I want you to know is, how do you know the
difference between a tag and an attribute? And the key is to look for
those brackets. Also you&#39;re gonna want to make sure that you know which
two symbols end a self-closing tag. All right. Don&#39;t forget, that&#39;s
where you have the forward slash in the closing bracket. These are the
kind of things that can really mess up your code when you try to
validate it later, and so being cognizant of these ideas in the
beginning will really help you write much cleaner code.</p>

<h3 id="ch2-02a">2.02 Cheatsheets</h3>

<p>There are many online &quot;cheat sheets&quot; for HTML. These files list all
of the HTML5 tags, and also include information about tags that are
common, but no longer supported by HTML. There are many cheat sheets
available, but here are links to three that I have recommended in the
past.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>WPKube has prepared an extensive, up-to-date, ultimate cheat sheet on 
    HTML 5 — it includes all the tags listed in alphabetical order. We also 
	included the availability of the tag from the previous HTML 4 version for 
	comparison. You can find it at: <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/" 
	target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ultimate HTML5 Cheat Sheet</a>[.]</p></li>
  <li><p>This next cheat sheet also provides information on tags, but has a

  <li><p>The third cheat sheet comes from Webaim.  It not only covers the tags, 
    but helps to explain the semantics and function of each tag and what

<h3>2.02 Semantic Tags</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to make sure that your page is accessible to as
many people as possible is to use semantic tags. When writing HTML, it
is easy to get carried away adding &lt;div&gt; elements. While your page
will still work, it can make your code hard to read and hard to
change.</p>
<p>We need to do our best to keep our code “clean” – this means using
the HTML5 structural elements where suitable. A quick refresher on
semantic tags can be found on the W3Schools site <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Semantic Elements</a>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="2.03 Semantic Tags" 
  alt="2.03 Semantic Tags." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi everybody. Today we&#39;re gonna be talking about some of the newer HTML5
tags that I like to refer to as the semantic tags. This is going to
continue our conversation about how we&#39;re trying to make our webpages
the most accessible as possible to as many people.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 121. how to design (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image121.png" 
  title="How to Design" 
  alt="How to Design." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Before we begin talking about specific tags, though, I want to talk
to you about the design of your webpage. Really, the most important step
in your web design is the design. Once you&#39;re down pat with the
different tags and typing in files, we&#39;re gonna change our focus to how
you want to lay out your page. And you need a really clear picture of
what you want to create before you can begin coding in earnest.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="How to Design Semantically" 
  alt="How to Design Semantically." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at this sample page. Again, it&#39;s just a quick sketch,
and it shows that I would like to have a header section, a footer
section, and a few other sections embedded in between the two of them.
Once I know that that&#39;s the kind of design I want, I can begin coding.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 123. using semantic tags - old div (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image123.png" 
  title="Using Semantic Tags - old &#39;div&#39;" 
  alt="Using Semantic Tags - old &#39;div&#39;." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>You may recall that one of the most common tags used to be the
<b>&lt;div&gt;</b> tag, because in the beginning, kind of dum, dum, dum,
you did everything with <b>&lt;div&gt;.</b> You would go through your
page, group it together, and put each group into a <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>
tag. These divs almost always had some sort of special class or id
associated with them. So for instance, one div might have the class of
header, another the section, another the footer. This way, you could
back to your design and really break it up in a way that worked best for
you.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 124. example, header tag (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image124.png" 
  title="Example, header tag" 
  alt="Example, header tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The first tag that I&#39;ll be talking to you about today is the header
tag. The header tag is typically used to group together introductory or
navigational aids. So you&#39;d put in your title, perhaps your navigation
bar, anything that really lets the user know right off the bat what this
page is about. The thing I want you to understand about the header tag
is that it is a <b>block</b> tag, and nothing more than that. There&#39;s no
special formatting or anything along that line. However, it does let the
user know that this is the header section. Now, most people will never
see the tags.</p>
<p>Remember, the browser looks at the tag and doesn&#39;t display it, instead
formats its content. But for people who are using screen readers or
other assistive devices, this is a great way for them to find what
they&#39;re looking for if they&#39;re not using visual clues. Another point I
wanna make is that the header tag should not be confused with the head
or different heading tags. This is going to happen to you a lot. Just
remember that the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> tag is for metadata, and the
<b>&lt;header&gt;</b> tag is more of just an aid.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 125. example, nav tag (navigation) (88) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image125.png" 
  title="Example, the navigation tag (nav)" 
  alt="Example, the navigation tag (nav)." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The next tag I&#39;m gonna talk to you about today is the <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b>
tag. The nav is basically a section of your page that links to other
pages or parts within your page. So, inside your nav you&#39;re not going to
have links to Facebook, or Google, or your LinkedIn account or anything
like that. Instead, it&#39;s really just links that go to other parts of
your site. For instance, here I&#39;ve made an unordered list with three
links. Each of them go to a different part of your page. There&#39;s a lot
of debate, for better, for worse, as to whether or not your
<b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> tags should be using lists, but the important thing
is to include the <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> tag to help people navigate through
your page. Oftentimes, you&#39;ll find the <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> tag embedded
inside the <b>&lt;header&gt;</b> tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 126. example, footer tag (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image126.png" 
  title="Example, footer tag" 
  alt="Example, footer tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Another tag is the <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b> tag, and this is a section
that contains information that is pretty typical for the bottom of the
page, such as copyright data, related documents, your links to social
media. And while I say that it&#39;s usually at the bottom of the page, this
is not required, nor does using the footer tag actually make it that
it&#39;ll show up at the bottom.</p>

<p>In this example here, I have my footer tag, my special entity to make
the copyright symbol, and then my name with a line break. And then I&#39;ve
also included a link back to my main site. Some of our other semantic
tags have a little bit more oomph to them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 127. example, figure tag (90) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image127.png" 
  title="Example, figure tag" 
  alt="Example, figure tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>For instance, one of the new tags is the <b>&lt;figure&gt;</b> tag, and
it has a lot more semantics than the image tag we&#39;ve gone over
previously. Every figure can include additional information. So you can
include an image, you can include multimedia, you can include a
combination of all of them. But it also has some additional tags such as
the figcaption. So what this is going to do is somebody who, it provides
additional information for somebody who may not be able to see it. So
the picture normally floats by itself when its in an image tag, this
lets you say, this text goes specifically with this image. Now again, we
do have the <b>&lt;alt&gt;</b> tag, which helps describe the picture,
but you have to remember, most of us will never see that.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>There are a number of other new tags in HTML5, and it&#39;s not really
possible for me to go over all of them. Instead, you&#39;ll find that as you
develop your pages and after you&#39;ve done your initial web design, you&#39;ll
logically just head towards these different tags. Some of them are
structural elements, such as article, summary, sections, etc. Others you
won&#39;t be using until we create forms. Another would be input types. Have
you ever noticed that sometimes on your phone, when you click on certain
buttons, different keyboards will pop up, depending on whether you&#39;re
typing in an email or a URL? These are all things to the new HTML5.
Email, date, color, etc., tags.</p>

<p>We&#39;re also gonna be able to talk about graphics elements such as
canvas, and also media elements which let you go ahead and put in your
movies and music of your choice. The important thing to remember is that
if you&#39;re developing your page, and you find yourself using a lot of
<b>&lt;div&gt;s,</b> you&#39;re going astray. You really want to use the
best tag available that will give the most meaning to the users.
Semantic guide tags are gonna help guide your users to the information
in your page. And that&#39;s really what you want to do, you want to make
your page the most accessible to as many people as possible.</p>

<h3>2.03 Code Placement</h3>

<p>When you write code, it is important to get into the good habits of
organizing your code. While there are no specific rules about how and
where to place your code, there are definitely conventions. (Conventions
are suggestions that most programmers follow. This way other programmers
can quickly and easily understand their code.)</p>

<p>The most common organization is to have one main folder with your html
files in it. There are also subfolders (folders inside the main folder)
for your image files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 129. folder/subfolder code placement (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image129.png" 
  title="Folder with list of documents nested within"
  alt="Folder with list of documents nested within." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:20%" />

<p>In this image you can see the following structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>My main folder is named WD4E </p></li>
  <li><p>The folder has one html file named <b><i>index.html</i></b> and one folder 
    called <b><i>images</i></b></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Using this structure to display the picture <b><i>bacon.jpg</i></b>
the code will be: </p>
<p><b>&lt;img src=&quot;images/bacon.jpg&quot; alt = &quot;Brown Labradoodle wearing a
fancy orange bandana&quot;&gt;</b></p>
<p>It is important that you use the proper case because on some
computers it matters so this would not work since the “I” in “image” is
capital rather than lowercase.</p>
<p><b>&lt;img src=&quot;Images/bacon.jpg&quot; alt = &quot;Brown Labradoodle wearing a
fancy orange bandana&quot;&gt;</b></p>
<p>It can be very frustrating at first to master folder structure.
However, understanding folder structures will help you, even if you
never code again.</p>

  title="2.04 Template Page in Visual Studio Code" 
  alt="2.04 Template Page in Visual Studio Code." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Earlier, I showed you how you can open the Visual Studio Code editor.
Let&#39;s go ahead and go back and actually create something real that has
been using the tags that we&#39;ve been talking about.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Minimum requirements; lab assignment." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The minimum requirements that I&#39;m going to want you to have is one,
create a real page and make sure to call it &quot;index.html&quot;. Remember,
&quot;index.html&quot; is the default name that all the browsers know to look for
when it goes to open up your site. I want your page to utilize the
header, main, and footer elements. Hey, don&#39;t cheat. These elements
should not be empty. Take this as a chance to create something
interesting. Then finally, as always, want you to make sure that your
page validates. Go in to the W3 validator and/or the WAVE validator to
take a look and see what&#39;s going on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~ 132. start with a shell; doctype, meta-data & displayable content (93) ~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Start with a Shell; Doctype, meta-data &amp; displayable content." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Make sure to start with the shell. The shell includes your doctype, any
meta-data, that&#39;s the head section, as well as your displayable content.
In the past, it was up to you to remember how to put that all in. But
thanks to Visual Studio Code and Replit, this will all be built-in to
the shell when you open up your editor. I&#39;m going to give you some
examples, but I really encourage you to take what I&#39;m about to do and
make it your own.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Create new file; index.html" 
  alt="Create new file; index.html." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The first step is to create a new file. I&#39;m going to call mine
&quot;index.html&quot;. It&#39;s going to go in my folder and then we&#39;ve got it. Step
2 is show off those super programming skills. Makes you feel like you&#39;re
in some sort of movie where they&#39;re typing a little bit and amazing
things are happening.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Enter Exclamation &amp; tab to automatically load shell program." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to type the exclamation point and Tab. It has now put the
shell of my program in for me. It has put in that I want HTML5. It has
put in the head data, which includes all this cool stuff about what it
should look like on a phone versus a laptop that we&#39;re not really using
yet. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m going to make this document about &quot;My Favorite
Foods.&quot;</p>
<p>In the body, I&#39;m going to use the main tag because I know that
accessibility checkers are going to be looking for main. So I&#39;m going to
put that in here. I&#39;m going to include an h1 tag because h1 tags really
make things pop and they help our users know what my page is about. It&#39;s
pretty common for your title and your h1 to be the exact same text. &quot;My
Favorite Foods.&quot;</p>

<p>Think I&#39;ll add a paragraph because I don&#39;t just think about food, I
think a lot about it. I&#39;m going to say something along the lines of,
&quot;Growing up in Ohio, my favorite restaurant was actually Rosie&#39;s Deli.&quot;
It was awesome. They had curly fries, they had milkshakes, they had
everything. See. Look at me not being a very good typist. &quot;My favorite
restaurant was Rosie&#39;s.&quot; Anyone notice how as I&#39;m typing, everything
doesn&#39;t quite fit in the screen?</p>

<p>See how I have to scroll back and forth? If this is happening to you,
you can go up to the &quot;View&quot; and you can turn on &quot;word wrap,&quot; and then
everything is going to fit nicely for you. My favorite food was Rosie&#39;s.
Accidentally typed an S in there. And let&#39;s put what my three favorite
foods were. I&#39;m going to use an ordered list and I&#39;m going to put in, it
was definitely the curly fries. Second was absolutely a chocolate
milkshake. I&#39;m trying to remember. They also had really good chicken
nuggets. You can see, I had very sophisticated taste in food. I have
done a lot of typing so far.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>One of the things I want to remind everybody is never do this much
typing without remembering to save. I can see that I haven&#39;t saved in a
while based on that circle. Instead of going up to &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Save,&quot; I&#39;m
going to do Command-S. I&#39;m going to wait a second and see if people
remember. I can see my code. How can I also see my deployed page? One
option is to go in and find &quot;index.html&quot; on your folder and open it up.</p>

<p>But instead, I&#39;m going to click on &quot;Go Live.&quot; When I did, you can see it
popped in my page up for me. I&#39;m going to make it a little bit bigger so
you can see everything. I also wanted to have a footer, so let&#39;s add a
footer in here. My footer is going to be &quot;Copyright Colleen van Lent.&quot;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Add footer and copyright to website." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to save my page, and you can see it popped up. Things are
looking good so far. If all we&#39;re looking at is my page, everything
looks good. But it&#39;s not a matter of things looking good to us on the
screen. It&#39;s a matter of validating. Let&#39;s go ahead and take this code.
I&#39;m going to open up the W3 validator. The W3 validator gives us a few
different choices.</p>

<p>We can validate by the URL. But we can&#39;t really do that when we&#39;re using
Sublime because there&#39;s no way for this service to be able to peek onto
our desktop or on our computer. We can do validate by file upload, where
you choose the file and upload it, but I&#39;m just going to do it by direct
input. I&#39;m going to grab all of my code here. Command A. Command C. I&#39;m
going to put it in here, and let&#39;s see what it says. It says hey, wait a
second. Down here near line 19, it says, &quot;element foote is not allowed
as a child of element body.&quot; Let&#39;s go take a look. Instead of calling it
a footer, I called it a foote. Let&#39;s go ahead and fix that up. And so
now that looks better. Let&#39;s go back and save it. I can just do live
server again, and it looks better.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do another check. Let&#39;s take this site and we would like to go to
the WAVE accessibility checker and check this site as well. But again,
we have a problem that it wants to know what the URL of our code is and
we don&#39;t have a URL because we&#39;re using Visual Studio Code. So you do
have a few options. One is that you can click on &quot;Browser Extensions.&quot;
I&#39;m going to add this to my page.</p>

<p>You can see it went through and it said, excellent. Boom. It went
through and it doesn&#39;t find any other errors or any contrast errors.
It&#39;s pretty unusual. I encourage you to go in, add a few more things,
add some typos, and see what happens. You might be surprised to see that
you&#39;re really starting to pick this up, and you might also be surprised
to see that it&#39;s really important to go slowly, save often, check often,
and make sure that you&#39;re writing code that you can be proud of that&#39;s
accessible.</p>

<p>What I want you to do is create a page called
&#39;“<strong>index.html</strong>.&#39;” Your page should utilize a
<strong>header</strong>, the <strong>main</strong>, and
<strong>footer</strong> elements, and these elements should not be
empty. You should be using this as an opportunity to be playing with the
things you&#39;ve learned. And of course, as you&#39;re coding, make sure that
your page validates. A lot of times we wait until the end and it can be
overwhelming to pick up on the mistakes that we&#39;ve made. I&#39;m going to
encourage you to save as you&#39;re developing and keep validating the

<p>With every website, we start with a shell. That shell is going to
include the <strong>doctype</strong> stating that it&#39;s an

for us right now going to be the title of our page, but as you become a
more confident programmer, it might include links to CSS files, to
JavaScript, or perhaps to Favicons. Finally, today you&#39;re going to focus
on the displayable content, adding in paragraphs or lists, eventually
we&#39;ll be adding images.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s open up <strong>Replit</strong> and create, test, share, and
validate it. I&#39;m going to begin by creating a <strong>Repl</strong>, I
want it to be an HTML file, and I had mentioned that we like to call our
files &#39;“<strong>index.html</strong>.&#39;” It&#39;s going to be a little bit
harder to do that with <strong>Replit</strong> since we put so many
files in the same place, but let&#39;s go ahead and go with it right here.
So, I&#39;ve got it&#39;s an HTML, CSS, JavaScript file, I&#39;ve named it
&#39;“<strong>index.html</strong>&#39;” and now I&#39;m going to click on
&#39;“Create.&#39;”</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Validate Replit Template" 
  alt="Validate Replit Template." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Right away, <strong>Replit</strong> is going to fill in that data
that we had talked about, it has our data type. It has our extra
meta-data where it tells us how big the screen is going to be and links
to style sheets. It&#39;s included a title, the title&#39;s
&#39;“<strong>Replit</strong>,&#39;” and it included some like, very basic code
that has the body. I&#39;m going to go ahead though and delete all of the
links to the JavaScript and start off with this really bare bones page
and I&#39;m going to save it, okay?</p>
<p>The first thing that I want to do is I want to take the code that
<strong>Replit</strong> gave us and see, does it validate? You have
three choices, you can validate by a <strong>URL</strong>, you can
validate using a file upload, which we don&#39;t really have the file on our
computer when we use <strong>Replit</strong>. So we can&#39;t use that one,
and we can do validate by direct input. I&#39;m going to go ahead and start
with the validate by direct input. You copy all the code, I&#39;m going to
do a quick command-C, I&#39;m going to put it in here and let&#39;s check it,
all right? You know, it&#39;s saying you&#39;re doing okay, there&#39;s a couple
warnings saying maybe it would be a good idea to say that the language
is going to be English. And it&#39;s also mentioning that they&#39;re using a
little bit of an old construct by adding a backslash s, but there&#39;s no
errors, so we&#39;re doing okay.</p>
<p>I also want to check it on the <strong>Wave Accessibility
Evaluator</strong>. I can do that by going back to the code, and I&#39;m
going to open up this site in a new window. There&#39;s two ways to do this,
one is to click on the little icon that says &#39;“open in a new tab.&#39;” I
don&#39;t always have the best of luck with that, but let&#39;s go ahead and try
it and see if it works right here. Your other option, just so you know
if it doesn&#39;t work for you, is to copy and paste this link right here,
all right?</p>

&#39;“hey, right here they&#39;re saying it&#39;s definitely a problem.&#39;” We want to
add in what the language is, all right, so let&#39;s go ahead and go back,

<p>Let&#39;s start adding that extra information. Maybe I want to talk to

my favorite movies from the 80s, all right, since I&#39;m changing the
topic, I&#39;m also going to change the title, &#39;“My Favorite,&#39;” I should
learn to type that word, &#39;“80s Movies.&#39;” It&#39;s not uncommon for the
<strong>title</strong> and the <strong>h1</strong> to be the same, or at
least very similar.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say to be honest, for me, &#39;“The 80s were great,&#39;” right? I had
a paper route, I could ride my bike, I went to a lot of movies, &#39;“So
what were the movies.&#39;” If I&#39;m going to list off my favorite movies, it
makes sense that I should use some sort of list. I could use an ordered
list, an fixed with <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong> if I wanted to rank
them. But since they&#39;re all so great, I&#39;m going to go ahead and do an
unordered list and include three things. Number one, we can&#39;t forget the
good old &#39;“Goonies,&#39;” all right? Style number two, I will do &#39;“Back to
the Future,&#39;” and we&#39;ll just do those two for right now.</p>

<p>When I save that, you can see it added a little &#39;“Copyright Colleen&#39;”
right here off to the side, everything looks great.</p>

  alt="Validate website using validator.w3.org." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that everything looks great, we always want to go
in as we&#39;re coding, I&#39;m going to do a copy and a paste, I&#39;m going to go
back here to the validator. Let&#39;s go ahead and check. And what&#39;s going
to pop up is you will notice that it gave me an error that says &#39;“the
element foot is not allowed a child of element body&#39;” somewhere near
line 18. Look at that, instead of calling it a footer, I had only called
it a foot, so I need to go in here and fix that up. Once I do, my page
is going to validate, and you can keep creating.</p>
<p>This is where I&#39;m going to leave you to create your own page about
things that are interesting to you. Don&#39;t forget to add that
<strong>head</strong> section, the <strong>main</strong> section, and
the <strong>footer</strong>, because as we learn about more
accessibility tools, you&#39;re going to realize that they are an important
step to making your page accessible for everyone.</p>

<h3>2.05.Starter Code for Template Page</h3>

<p>I just want to give you some sample template code. If need be, you
can copy and paste this to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>****************************************
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>2.05 Images and Icons</h3>

<p>It is difficult to believe that the internet used to be all text. 
Knowing how to incorporate visual media (images, icons, videos, etc) is
an important part of the process of building a webpage.    Before you
continue with the next lessons I encourage you to review the old reading
on images and the new reading below about icons.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Images</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp"

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/icons/" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools Icons</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only do we want to talk about how to add images and icons to our
page, we will want to talk about making sure that they are accessible.
We can do this by using <strong>alt</strong> text, transcripts, and
aria-labels.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on <strong>alt</strong> text so make sure to watch
for these important guidelines while you watch the upcoming
lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The text should describe the image if the image contains information</p></li>
  <li><p>The text should explain where the link goes if the image is inside an &lt;a&gt; element</p></li>
  <li><p>Use alt=&#39;“&#39;” if the image is only for decoration</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Making All of Your Images Accessible Everywhere</h3>

<p>Understanding how images work on other platforms is important too.
For instance, when you make a presentation at work you can add
alternative text to the images and charts in your slides. When you post
to social media you can add descriptive text.</p>
<p>Here are some resources for you to use:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en" 
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest Help Page</a>.

<p>Since platforms change all of the time you may find that the links
above have changed.  Or maybe there is a different platform you are
interested in. You can also use the search phrase below with your
platform at the end.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“How do I add descriptive text to images on ….”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, if your app doesn’t support alternative text, consider using
one that does and then using the app to link to it.</p>

<h2 id="ch2-06">2.06 Images (9:28)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 155. images (2.06) (107) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image155.png" 
  title="2.06 Images" 
  alt="2.06 Images." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>It may be hard to believe, but when you think about the early days of
the Internet, there were actually no images at all. Now, it&#39;s hard to
find a page that doesn&#39;t actually have more images than text. As you add
images to your page, we want to make sure that you do it the right way.
Not just by writing good, accessible, clean code, but also making sure
your images look the way that you want them to look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 156. images - its more than the tag (108) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image156.png" 
  title="Images - its more than the tag" 
  alt="Images - its more than the tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The image tag really has a lot of things going on with it. Many file
types are supported when you&#39;re making your web page. Your files can be
what we call jpeg, which might be a .jpg. It might be a .jpeg and that
matters. It might be a GIF or it might be a PNG. There are some fancier
options with things called SVG and BMP images. And the important thing
to know is that when you&#39;re making your files and when you&#39;re adding
them to your page, these file extensions must be included. Your computer
doesn&#39;t know what that type of file is unless you tell it.</p>
<p>The other important thing to know is that if someone is visiting your
page and looking at your images, your page is being downloaded onto
their computer. But their computer also needs to take the time to
download each and every single one of your images. If you are creating a
site that has a lot of pictures, it might be really hard for someone
with a slow internet to actually be able to access all of them. Size can
definitely be a factor. Every image requires its own
<strong>HTTP</strong> Request, so if those images are broken, if they
don&#39;t belong to you, if they&#39;re behind a paywall, it can all mess up
your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 157. image sizes (108) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image157.png" 
  title="Images Sizes" 
  alt="Images Sizes." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The first thing you need to realize is that when you link an image,
your browser displays the image as big or as small as the file. And that
size is rarely optimal. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever happened to you where
someone for me, it&#39;s usually my mom will email me a picture and I&#39;m like
trying to see it all and it&#39;s like scroll, scroll, scroll, and it never
really fits. Or if someone texts it to me, it&#39;s so tiny I can barely see
it. The quick solution for that is you can either change the file or we
can use something called width and height attributes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 158. using an editor (109) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image158.png" 
  title="Using an Editor" 
  alt="Using an Editor." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>If you decide to use an editor to permanently change the style of the
image, that&#39;s only going to really work on what we call like local
files, the files that you have stored on your computer. If you are
trying to use an image from somebody else&#39;s site, you can&#39;t really
change the size of their picture, right? You don&#39;t own it, but any of
your local images. You can use something like preview or Paint to open
it up and adjust the size to how you would like it to fit not only the
size, but you can also crop it to different dimensions.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 159. using attributes (109) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image159.png" 
  title="Using Attributes" 
  alt="Using Attributes." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>However, more and more people are using these, what we call
attributes to size the image. It used to be the case that you never
wanted to use your HTML code to set the size of your picture. But we&#39;re
realizing that using width can actually improve the accessibility of
your page. So when you start using the <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag,
I want you to include at least the <strong>width</strong> attribute. You
don&#39;t need both, but at least the <strong>width</strong> attribute. And
what that will do is it means when your page is loaded, it&#39;ll keep the
pictures from flashing and flickering as they adjust to different
sizes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 160. example, figure - default image size (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image160.png" 
  title="Example, figure, img src, figcaption - default image size" 
  alt="Example, figure, img src, figcaption - default image size." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s look at what I&#39;m talking about. What I have here is a
<strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong> tag and inside my figure I have an image
and a figure caption. You can see that I&#39;ve used
<strong>src=&#39;“imgs/Ashtabula.jpg&#39;”</strong> That means I have a folder.
And somewhere in that folder there&#39;s something called Ashtabula. There&#39;s
a picture called &#39;“<strong>Ashtabula.jpg</strong>.&#39;” If that picture
can&#39;t load, then I have what we call the alternative text that describes
it as &#39;“My house.&#39;” That&#39;s not great alternative text. A better
alternative text would be a visual description of my house, but that
doesn&#39;t fit on a slide very well. You&#39;ll have to forgive me on this
one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 161. example, using width in pixels (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image161.png" 
  title="Example, using width in pixels" 
  alt="Example, using width in pixels." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>You can also, if you&#39;d like, set the <strong>width</strong> of that
picture. If the picture of my house was too big, we can say, you know
what, when we load this picture, let&#39;s make sure it&#39;s always 500 pixels
wide. By only setting the width, it will automatically set the height so
that it height doesn&#39;t skew the picture. It&#39;ll still look really good,
right? That is one way to do it by hard coding it to how many pixels you
want it to be. This may have been a fine idea to use back in the early
2000s, but nowadays we realize that people might be looking at your
website, on a phone, on a tablet, on a really large screen.</p>
<p>What looks good on one screen may not look good on another. 500
pixels may be too big for my phone and too small for my giant
screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 162. example, using width and height (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image162.png" 
  title="Example, using width and height" 
  alt="Example, using width and height." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the things we could do is set the height to match our screen
size. But that&#39;s often going to skew our image size, right? It&#39;s just
not going to look good.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 163. example, using percentages (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image163.png" 
  title="Example, using percentages" 
  alt="Example, using percentages." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>A better idea is to use <strong>percentages</strong>. In this
example, I&#39;ve done same exact image, same exact <strong>alt</strong>
text. But the difference is its width equals 50%. What does that 50%
mean? 50% of what? Well, typically the browser is going to open up the
page and it&#39;s going to look and see how much space is this figure tag
taking up and maybe the figure is taking up the whole width of your
browser. It&#39;s going to set your picture to 50% of the browser. As you
make your screen bigger, the picture will get bigger. As you make the
screen smaller, the picture will get smaller. It&#39;s a nice way to make
the picture fluid. We call it fluid measurements and to be reactive and
responsive to people.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 164. favicons (112) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image164.png" 
  title="Favicons" 
  alt="Favicons" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In addition to regular images that use the image tag, people like to
use things called <strong>favicons</strong>. <strong>Favicons</strong>
are those little tiny images that show up inside the tab of your
browser. If you look, you&#39;ll see that Coursera has its own favicon. If
you are looking at a Google Doc, you&#39;ll see it has its own
<strong>favicon</strong>. You can make your own <strong>favicon</strong>
if you want. The difference between <strong>favicons</strong> and image
tags is that the <strong>favicon</strong> always goes in the head
section. Instead of using the image tag, what I have here is link, what
type of relationship I have. This is going to be an icon. It&#39;s going to
be a PNG file, and that PNG file is located in my images folder.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 165. alternative text attribute (113) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image165.png" 
  title="Alternative Text Attribute" 
  alt="Alternative Text Attribute." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I can&#39;t stress enough that when you use images, it&#39;s very, very, very
important to use alternative text. What alternative text will do is it
provides basically words for non-text content. If someone&#39;s using a
screen reader, every time it gets to an image, the screen reader will
read off the description that you included. If an image isn&#39;t loading,
either because you wrote the wrong image name or because someone&#39;s
internet is slow and they can&#39;t download it, it&#39;ll actually be displayed
in place of the images. This is great for both accessibility and for
debugging and figuring out which of your pictures aren&#39;t working.</p>
<p>Also, by including alternative text, you&#39;re providing semantic
meaning for search engines. So, if you have a business and you would
like to promote that business, alternative text has these kind of sneaky
side benefits as well as just being, you know, a decent human being.</p>

<img src="./images/image166.png" 
  title="Review; file extensions and style with height/width" 
  alt="Review; file extensions and style with height/width." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>As you start to do images, they&#39;re going to be great, but you&#39;re
going to have some problems and it&#39;s going to take some time to get them
to work. So, if things aren&#39;t working right, make sure you&#39;re using the
right file extensions. If it&#39;s .jpg, jpg, make sure you&#39;re not writing
.jpeg, or vice versa. Don&#39;t name all your files &#39;“image_26859,&#39;” blah
blah blah, right? Rename them. Give them a good name. Because often the
file names are a problem. Or when I use that fancy term file path, that
usually means you&#39;ve hopefully been putting all of your images into an
image folder, but you forgot to include that folder name when you were
linking it.</p>
<p>For now, as you start to use images, make sure you are setting that
height and or width in the HTML code itself using the attribute. If you
decide to learn more with us, you can later learn about how to use CSS
to do even more with your images to make them pop. Good luck.</p>

  alt="2.07 Accessible Images."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I know we&#39;ve talked about images in the past, but I&#39;d really like to
take a moment for us to stop and talk about them a little bit more. They
often say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but we need to think
about, is there a way to also have a picture, say, maybe 10 or 11 words,
a way to describe what you were hoping to represent by including that
image on your page?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 168. alternative text attribute (115) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image168.png" 
  title="Alternative Text Attribute" 
  alt="Alternative Text Attribute." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>And that&#39;s what brings us to the alternative text attribute.
Alternative text is going to provide a texture alternative to what we
call non-text content, right? So if you have a picture, any image on
your screen, what&#39;s going to happen when a screen reader gets to
that?</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t include alternative text, what&#39;s going to happen is that
the screen reader is going to read off the title of your image, and
that&#39;s rarely a very good thing to do. It also is used when you&#39;re
debugging to display in place of images. So if you forget to link your
image correctly or you forgot to download an image, it&#39;s really handy
when instead of just seeing a little broken icon, it actually shows you
what image you meant to have there.</p>
<p>It also provides semantic meaning for search engines, which improves
basically the amount of traffic that you might get to your page. These
are all things, though, that I&#39;ve mentioned before, so I really want to
talk to you a little bit more in depth into how to create alternative
text attributes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 169. creating good alt text (116) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image169.png" 
  title="Creating Good alt text" 
  alt="Creating Good alt text." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>A key to creating good <strong>alt</strong> text is to be accurate
and succinct. You don&#39;t want to be redundant. Your <strong>alt</strong>
text shouldn&#39;t say &#39;“picture of,&#39;” &#39;“graphic of,&#39;”. For instance, if I
have a picture of my three children and they are pushing themselves,
pushing each other into a pool, I don&#39;t need to say, &#39;“picture of three
children pushing each other into a pool.&#39;” I want to think about, all
right, why did I add this image? Should it really be like the
<strong>alt</strong> text of, &#39;“my children having fun?&#39;” Should it be,
&#39;“my children being idiots,&#39;” right? Why did I put the picture there?
That&#39;s what you want to think about when you&#39;re creating good
<strong>alt</strong> text.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 170. empty alt text (116) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image170.png" 
  title="Empty alt text" 
  alt="Empty alt text." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Sometimes a picture is just there because you kind of just had some
space to fill. So it&#39;s actually okay to leave <strong>alt</strong> text
as blank, but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have the <strong>alt</strong>
attribute, it means you&#39;re actually going to use alt=&#39;“&#39;”. Because
that&#39;s you and I saying to somebody, hey, we know that alternative text
is important, and we want you to know that this picture just doesn&#39;t
have any important extra meaning.</p>

<img src="./images/image171.png" 
  title="Long alt Text" 
  alt="Long alt Text." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>For some images, especially infographics, right? Like and the charts
and the things that have a ton of information, you might think, how in
the world can I create succinct <strong>alt</strong> text for that?
There&#39;s too much information. So if that&#39;s the case, there is a special
thing that you can use called a <strong>long alt</strong> text. But my
recommendation would be instead to create an entirely second page where
you really talk about the details of the infographic and just link to
it. So when someone gets to the page, if it has a lot of complicated
information, they can take that time to digest it.</p>

<img src="./images/image172.png" 
  title="Finding Usable Images" 
  alt="Finding Usable Images." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>You&#39;ve decided that you&#39;re going to include images on your page,
you&#39;re going to include the <strong>alt</strong> text, where can you
find the images for your site? You can always use your own personal
images, right? You own those, those are great. You can also use images
from image sharing sites, and we&#39;ll include some links for places that
you can find that you can use images that have what we call Creative
Commons usage.</p>
<p>What this means is when you go in and you search for the images,
there&#39;s actually a little option you can turn on that says &#39;“usage
rights&#39;” and Creative Commons usage means someone has said, hey, I am
100% okay with you using my pictures so long as you&#39;re not using them to
make money. Another option which is becoming extremely popular is to use
icons. Icons are those almost little cartoonish looking infographics
that you can use on your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 173. example, emojis & icons (118) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image173.png" 
  title="Example, Emojis &amp; Icons" 
  alt="Example, Emojis &amp; Icons." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Speaking of icons, a lot of times people will talk about emojis and
icons interchangeably and basically how popular they are. The nice thing
about if you include an emoji on your site is that it will be read by a
screen reader, right? The screen reader knows when you have a smiley
face, when you have a flag waving, etc, things like that.</p>
<p>A screen reader does not know what to do when it comes across an
icon. And since icons aren&#39;t images, they can&#39;t use the
<strong>alt</strong> attribute instead. If you decide to use icons,
there&#39;s a brand new attribute that I want to introduce, and it&#39;s called
&#39;“<strong>aria-label</strong>.&#39;” And the <strong>aria-label</strong>
will read off what that icon is about. In this case, if I have the
little icon of Pinterest, I would add <strong>aria-label</strong>,
Pinterest. If I had basically any icon at all, think about what would
you like someone to say out loud to you if you wanted to describe what
that icon is representing?</p>

<p>When you use images, I&#39;d like you to also think about where those
images are coming from, who you&#39;re representing, and what you&#39;re trying
to make out of your page. Don&#39;t constrain yourself to the most common
images, right? If you do an image search, it&#39;s really easy to put
something like favorite foods, and if you&#39;re me, pizza will show up, or
maybe popcorn. But instead, maybe you could include &#39;“favorite foods
from&#39;” and fill in someplace that you&#39;ve traveled recently and you&#39;d
like to show off maybe something from different cultures.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re doing athletes, you can include athletes in adaptive sports
whenever you&#39;re having pictures of people try to get people of different
body types, right? It only takes a few seconds to make your pictures
more impactful, so there&#39;s really no reason not to do it anymore.</p>
<p>Plus, using diverse images has the ability to draw more people to
your site because everyone likes to see somebody who looks like them or
someone that they kind of aspire to be. So I would like to encourage you
to use images in the most impactful way possible. And so I&#39;m putting
into some of the resources, places that I have discovered you can look
to try to improve kind of your own outlook.</p>

<img src="./images/image175.png" 
  title="Example, Tips" 
  alt="Example, Tips." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I want to finish with some tips. One is, there&#39;s a great website
called <strong>alt</strong> Decision Tree, a decision tree is basically
when it asks you a question and it&#39;s yes or no, yes or no. So there&#39;s a
great <strong>alt</strong> decision tree to help you figure out what
type of alternative text you should add to your images.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using something else that&#39;s visual, but not an image, such
as an icon, make sure to use <strong>aria-labels</strong>. I know I said
that a screen reader would read emojis, but still, let&#39;s avoid excessive
emojis, it can be hard to follow for people who rely on text, right?
Reading text. And then finally, try to diversify your images. It&#39;s kind
of fun to go out and when you show off your page, people to go, &#39;“I&#39;ve
never seen that before,&#39;” or, &#39;“hey, that&#39;s something really exciting
food that I would like to try.&#39;” So do what you can to try to just make
sure that the page reflects yourself and the best self that you can
be.</p>

<h3>Alternative Text</h3>

<p>Creating good alternative text is almost an art. The good news is
that it is an art that even artistically-challenged people like myself
can do well. The key is to think about the meanings behind your images,
not a description of them. So here are some tips:</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Decide what information the image conveys:</strong> Does
    someone need to see the page to understand your message? If not, you can
	treat the image as decorative use a null (empty) text alternative
	(alt=&#39;“&#39;”). Make sure not to include a space inside the quotes since
	some screen readers may then read it aloud.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>If the image is information, be complete, but concise</strong>: 
    In most cases you should be able to use a short phrase or sentence as 
	<strong>alt</strong> text.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Prioritize information in text alternative:</strong> Aim to put 
    the most important information at the beginning.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Avoid superfluous information:</strong> There is rarely a need 
    to use the words “image”, “icon”, or “picture” in the <strong>alt</strong> 
	text.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Handle complex images as a special case:</strong> Complex images 
    such as graphs, charts, maps, and illustrations contain substantial information 
	– more than can be conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. In these cases, a 
	two-part text alternative is required. The first part is the short description 
	to identify the image and, where appropriate, indicate the location of the long 
	description. The second part is the long description – a textual representation 
	of the essential information conveyed by the image.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ch2-08">2.08 Hyperlinks (9:23)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 176. hyperlinks (2.08) (121) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image176.png" 
  title="2.08 Hyperlinks" 
  alt="2.08 Hyperlinks." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi, today we&#39;re going to be talking about hyperlinks, or links, as
they&#39;re more commonly called. And how you can use them to link your
document with others out there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 177. links (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image177.png" 
  title="Links"
  alt="Links" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Now, links are really what make the web a web. It&#39;s this whole idea
that different links built together create this kind of knowledge that
search engines or you yourself can gain by going from page to page to
page, and with hopefully related material. So, let&#39;s get right into how
you create a link on your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 178. example, anchor links (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image178.png" 
  title="Example, Anchor links" 
  alt="Example, Anchor links." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Links are called anchor links and that&#39;s where we get the a for in
the <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag. When you use an anchor tag, the
<strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag you&#39;re going to need to make sure that
you&#39;ve two different parts. You need a hyper reference and you need
content. So the hyper reference is just the reference to the location of
the new content. So in this case I used
<strong>http://www.umich.edu</strong>. That tells a browser, if somebody
clicks on this link this is where I want to request the new page from.
We also need to have content. The content is what we call the clickable
part. In this case, it&#39;s text. I would actually click on an underlined
text that says, University of Michigan. But in some cases, it might be
an image instead.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 179. types of links (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image179.png"
  title="Types of links; Absolute, Relative, Internal and Graphical"
  alt="Types of links; Absolute, Relative, Internal and Graphical." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So what types of links can we have? Some of the most common are
called absolute links. We also have relative links. Internal links and
graphical links and I&#39;m gonna show you examples of each one of
those.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 180. example, absolute reference (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image180.png" 
  title="Example, Absolute Reference"
  alt="Example, Absolute Reference." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>With an absolute reference in the href section we need to put a fully
formed <strong>URL</strong>. You need to have the <strong>http</strong>
or <strong>https</strong>, the address, and any type of extra document
name you want. So if you remember there&#39;s three parts to
<strong>URL</strong>, you have the protocol, the host, and the document.
You need to include all of those if you have an absolute reference,
right? Everything else is still pretty much the same.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 181. example, relative references (124) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image181.png" 
  title="Example, Relative References" 
  alt="Example, Relative References." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>For a relative reference, we slightly change what goes in to the
href. Instead of linking to some outside or even internal webpage, we&#39;re
only going to put, in this case, the file name.</p>
<p>So in this case we&#39;re going to link to &#39;“page2.html.&#39;” You might get
slightly more in-depth than that, where you can include also some sort
of folder name. So in this case we&#39;d be going to the file called
&#39;“page2.html&#39;” but it&#39;s in a different folder called &#39;“docs.&#39;”</p>
<p>The third way we can use a relative reference is to what we call use
the ID tag. So when you have href equals hash pound or history, we&#39;re
saying there&#39;s another location inside the same file and it&#39;s called
&#39;“history.&#39;”</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 182. absolute vs relative (124) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image182.png" 
  title="Absolute vs Relative" 
  alt="Absolute vs Relative." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Absolute versus relative links. When would you use absolute links
versus when would you use relative links? With absolute links, you&#39;re
basically saying, I am not in charge of this page, somebody else is. If
you&#39;re linking to somebody else&#39;s page, absolutely use the absolute link
with the full reference in there. For relative is when you&#39;re developing
your own site. And it&#39;s really helpful to use relative links instead of
absolute, so that way if you move your page to a different server, or
you move it into a different folder, you don&#39;t need to rename
everything. And so those are some of the benefits to using local links,
is just the idea that you don&#39;t need to update as much.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that you need to make sure that you never do
is have a link that includes some sort of file structure, we&#39;ll call it.
So check your links. Make sure that it never says, &#39;“C:page&#39;” or
&#39;“MyDocumentsPage&#39;” or anything that is very specific to your computer.
The reason that you don&#39;t wanna do that is, If you put your page out on
the web. If you&#39;re done you&#39;ve put it up on a server or a hosting and
you want other people to click. Well, it doesn&#39;t make sense that they
would be able to access pages that are on your computer. So never ever
have a reference that includes something local to your machine. All
right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 183. example, using images as the link (125) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image183.png" 
  title="Example, Using images as the link"
  alt="Example, Using images as the link."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the other things that you can do is you can use images as the
link. So the clickable component doesn&#39;t have to be text. You&#39;ve seen
this a lot. It can be icons, images. different things along that
line.</p>
<p>In this case, I went in and I use the regular h reference and what
we&#39;re changing now, is not the h reference, but content that goes
between the opening and closing tag. and I have gone ahead and I&#39;ve put
in an image instead. Make sure that you use the <strong>alt</strong>
text to go along with that image.</p>
<p>In another case I&#39;ve done something very similar, the only difference
is, instead of using a local reference right here for the image, I&#39;ve
used an absolute reference. I&#39;ve put in the entire
<strong>URL</strong>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 184. usability issues (126) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image184.png" 
  title="Usability Issues" 
  alt="Usability Issues." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s talk usability issues and accessibility issues. If you&#39;re going
to use a clickable component, you wanna make sure that it has an informative 
name. There&#39;s software out there that can list all of the links within a 
page for people who are looking for things, who can&#39;t use typical. typical 
means of accessing the page. It is not at all helpful to them if all the links 
are labelled, &#39;“click here,&#39;” &#39;"click here,&#39;" &#39;"click 
here,&#39;" right? You want to give it some sort of informative name.</p>

<p>You also want to make sure that if you are using an image for the clickable 
portion of your link. That image needs to have some sort of <strong>alt</strong> 
text or other information available to those who can&#39;t see the image.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 185. examples; absolute, relative & embedded links (126) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image185.png" 
  title="Example; absolute, relative and embedded links" 
  alt="Example; absolute, relative and embedded links." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let me show you some coded example of those types of links. As you can see 
here, I have a reference to absolute references, relative references, images as 
links, and then some embedded links, as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 186. bottom screen shows url as you hover (127) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image186.png" 
  title="URL displayed on bottom when you hover over a link"
  alt="URL displayed on bottom when you hover over a link."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>If I were to click on &#39;“Washtenaw Dairy&#39;” or &#39;"Rosie&#39;s 
Coffee Bar and Bakery,&#39;" or &#39;"Dexter&#39;s Bakery&#39;" etc., it would 
actually take me to their pages. Head back. One of the tricks I want to point 
out as I&#39;m doing this is, as I hover over each one of these links, if you 
look at the very, very bottom of my browser, and I can&#39;t really show at the 
same time, but as you highlight it, it shows you which <strong>URL</strong>
you are going to. And I think this is very valuable for people to know, because 
if you&#39;re ever hovering over a link, and the information you see at the 
bottom of the page doesn&#39;t match what you expect, I wouldn&#39;t click on it. 
So absolute references takes you away from your site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 187/188. relative references within your folder (127) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image187.png" 
  title="Relative reference within your folder" 
  alt="Relative reference within your folder." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />
<img src="./images/image188.png" 
  title="Click image for larger viewing" 
  alt="Click image for larger viewing." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />

<p>Relative references can take you to something that&#39;s within your folder.
So right here I have an image of some doughnuts, and I have gone on and
they&#39;re in my folder in my file. So I was able to link to them just
using the picture name. All right? We can also use images as links as
well. Instead of writing &#39;“Doughnuts from the Squire Shop,&#39;” I went
ahead and made it so you can click on the image to get to the larger
view.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 189. embedded links (128) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image189.png" 
  title="Embedded links" 
  alt="Embedded links." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>This last idea of embedded links is a little bit interesting. So let me bring 
you over to the code for just a second and show you. Right down here, I have 
something called &#39;"Relative References&#39;" with an id=&#39;"relative&#39;". 
I have embedded links with an id that says &#39;"embedded&#39;" and up here, at 
the very beginning you can see I have <strong>&lt;div id =&#39;"absolute&#39;"&gt;.</strong>. 
With embedded links, I can click on any of these and navigate within the same 
page. So I&#39;m not gonna go to a different page. I&#39;m not gonna open up a 
new tab. Instead I&#39;m gonna jump to different places within the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 190. embedded references (129) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image190.png" 
  title="Embedded References" 
  alt="Embedded References." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>So I went to Absolute. I went to Relative now if I try to do Embedded
references it doesn&#39;t look like it moved but it really did. It&#39;s just
that we&#39;re already there. All right, so that is how these kind of
embedded or internal links work, right? Now if at any time you get
confused about how code is working.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 191. view developer source (129) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image191.png" 
  title="View Developer Source" 
  alt="View Developer Source." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I just want to remind you that you can always go to &#39;“view.&#39;”
&#39;“Developer&#39;” and &#39;“view source&#39;” to really get a better idea of how
people are creating their pages and their links.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 192. targets; _self, _blank, _top & _parent (130) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image192.png"
  title="Target; May be _self, _blank, _top, or _parent"
  alt="Target; May be _self, _blank, _top, or _parent." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Next, let&#39;s talk about targets, all right? Anchors can take a
different target attribute as well. We&#39;ve got the source, let&#39;s add
anchor or target. So you might have target equals <strong>self</strong>.
This is kind of the default action. This is going to happen if you don&#39;t
put anything at all. If you don&#39;t even include target, and what it means
is when you click on a link, open up in the same tab or window that
you&#39;re looking at right now.</p>

<p>If you put target equals <strong>blank</strong>. You&#39;re going to
leave the current page that you&#39;re in exactly the same, and open up a
new tab or window for where you want the new page to be opened. Now this
has its upside and downside. The upside is that your site is still open
in someone&#39;s window. The downside is that many people don&#39;t like it when
it keeps adding on and adding on, and as they progress through your
page, you&#39;re making them open more and more tabs.</p>

<p>There are two other options that we&#39;re not going to really talk about
here, but you can see them in the reading, and those are
<strong>top</strong> and <strong>parent</strong>, and that deals with if
you&#39;re really getting into the idea of having multiple windows, frames,
etc. open.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 193. review; links can be absolute, relative and internal (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Review; Links can be absolute, relative and internal" 
  alt="Review; Links can be absolute, relative and internal."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s review, because making sure that you understand links is
vitally important to your success in this course or even in just
understanding HTML. The first thing you need to know is a page without
links is extremely rare. And to be honest, it&#39;s almost not even a web
page. It&#39;s just a document. Links can be <strong>absolute,
relative</strong> and <strong>internal</strong>.</p>

<p>And internal, again, was where it had the hash mark in it. I think I
may have referred to them as relative, but I wanna make sure I&#39;m clear
that the <strong>hash</strong> mark makes it <strong>internal</strong>.
You want to use caution when using images in links. It&#39;s not that
they&#39;re not a great thing to do, and I&#39;m not saying you should do it.
I&#39;m just saying make sure that you do it carefully to ensure that
everyone who is viewing your page can get the same content and the same
experience as everyone else.</p>

<h2>Hyperlink Tag</h2>

<p>Hopefully you have already glanced over the readings on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML
Hyperlinks</a>. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" class="uri" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp</a> An anchor
or &#39;“link&#39;” is made up of three parts:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>The opening tag,</p></li>
  <li><p>The &#39;“clickable&#39;” part which might be a text or a graphic, and </p></li>
  <li><p>The closing tag.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is true that most elements have three parts, but the anchor
element can take a little more time to master.</p>

<h2 id="opening-tag">Opening tag</h2>

<p>The opening tag always has a hyper reference (&#39;“href&#39;”) that tells
the browser what the element should link to. The element may be
<strong>external</strong> – it links to a separate site, it may be
<strong><em>internal</em></strong> - it links to another page on the
same site, or it may be a <strong><em>jump</em></strong> link – a link
that takes you to a specific part of a webpage. An external link uses an
absolute reference. An internal link uses a relative reference, and a
jump link uses the hashtag followed by the id of the element you want to
jump to.</p>
<p>Another attribute that is often found in the opening tag is
<strong><em>target.</em></strong> This attribute tells the browser
whether the new link should be opened in the current browser window, a
new window, or a new tab. Note, using the target attribute can lead to
some accessibility issues since the appearance of new windows that were
not requested by the user can disorient users and/or be missed
completely by them. (It is completely optional, but you can read more
about this at the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H83.html" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAI &#39;| W3C
page</a>.) https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H83.html</p>

<h2>Tag contents</h2>

<p>Another characteristic of hyperlinks is the content between the
opening and closing tags. Until now, that content had always been text.
However, a link can be made up of any content – text, graphics, videos,
etc. </p>
<p>For accessibility reasons the content should clearly indicate what
the link represents. That means avoid having multiple links that display
&#39;“Learn More…&#39;”.  If the content is an image, the image should be
descriptive and include meaningful <strong>alt</strong> text. If the
content is an icon or other graphic, it should use the &#39;“aria-label&#39;”
attribute so that a screen reader can audibly provide the visual
information. (Another optional reading to learn more about aria-label is
at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aria-label
- Accessibility &#39;| MDN</a>)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label</p>

<h3>Closing tag</h3>

<p>Whew! The closing tag is just a nice normal closing tag. However, if
you forget to include this tag it has the unfortunate effect of turning
everything on your page (until the next tag) into a big underlined
link.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi, today we&#39;re gonna talk about some of the tags that you may find
extremely useful as you go and try to add blocks of code and simple
snippets of different things to your web page. I know that it can seem
overwhelming how many tags there are in HTML5. So today, I&#39;m going to
try to break down some of the most useful ones. Now, I realize it may
seem overwhelming as I said throwing all these elements at you. You&#39;re
not supposed to memorize them all by the end of this lecture. Instead,
I&#39;m really just trying to give you a taste for what&#39;s out there so you
can start playing with your own code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 195. choosing your tag; generic & semantic (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image195.png" 
  title="Choosing your tag; generic &amp; semantic" 
  alt="Choosing your tag; generic &amp; semantic." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the first things you need to decide when you&#39;re coding is,
which tags are you going to use? There are the generic kind of what we
call <strong>block</strong> tags, <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> that break your code into nice sections.
Paragraph is self-explanatory, and <strong>div</strong> gives you a way
to put groups of content together. But the problem with both
<strong>div</strong> and paragraph is that they&#39;re very generic.</p>
<p>So we want to move over to the idea of using these semantic tags,
such as <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;nav&gt;,</strong> <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong> And we talked about those in an earlier
lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 196. list of block tags (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image196.png" 
  title="List of block tags" 
  alt="List of block tags." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Some of the other <strong>block</strong> tags that you may not be
familiar with are listed here. The first one are the containers.
Containers are simple things where you can put like-minded code
together. So you might have an <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> or an
<strong>&lt;aside&gt;,</strong> a <strong>&lt;section&gt;,
&lt;main&gt;.</strong> Again, they almost seem generic in their names.
But as you grow more comfortable, as you&#39;re designing your website, you
can start to see oh, this isn&#39;t a generic section. This really is an
aside.</p>
<p>The next <strong>block</strong> tag is <strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong>,
or horizontal rule. And it&#39;s really an interesting idea because it
doesn&#39;t contain any text at all. Just to remind you,
<strong>block</strong> tags are tags that have the display
<strong>block</strong>. It means it forces a new line above and below.
There&#39;s never going to be anything next to it by default. So our hard
rule will just put a single line across your page, simple yet very much
used by many people.</p>
<p>The next one is <strong>&lt;address&gt;</strong>. This will be a
<strong>block</strong> tag, and it doesn&#39;t format your address any
differently than other text. But what it does is, it allows screen
readers and other assisted devices to quickly and easily find if they&#39;re
looking for your address<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;blockquote&gt;</strong> will be another
<strong>block</strong> tag as well as <strong>&lt;details&gt;</strong>
Now the details tag is very interesting in this kind of quote you get
into work. And what it does is elastic hand having drop down open and
close idea with your text. Now, just to warn you it is not implemented
in Firefox so if you&#39;re someone with Firefox who tries to run it its
just gonna kinda default to this open idea.</p>
<p>Alright, so there&#39;s <strong>&lt;hr&gt;, &lt;address&gt;,
&lt;blockquote&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;details&gt;.</strong> I&#39;ve
told you what they were. My guess is, you still have no idea what they
really do, so let&#39;s take a look at a quick example.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 197. some common block tags (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image197.png"
  title="Common block tags; hr, address, blockquote and details/summary"
  alt="Common block tags; hr, address, blockquote and details/summary." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Here would be an example of the hr element. It&#39;s just a simple line
across the screen, nothing too fancy, but very recognizable. The next
one, the address element. In this case, the browser does italicize
what&#39;s inside the content. I had to put my own end line here, but
otherwise it just looks kind of italicized. But you can&#39;t be sure that
it&#39;ll be italicized on every browser. It&#39;s really specific to Chrome,
Firefox, Safari et cetera. But the important thing to know is that there
is semantic meaning here.</p>
<p>Here we have a block quote, and what block quote does, is it lets,
indents the code and kind of lets people know that there&#39;s a quote that
you&#39;re look at. One of the things that I put inside my blockquote, was I
put in a cite tag, so someone can know right away that I cited Napoleon
Hill. So if someone&#39;s doing a search for Napoleon Hill, this is going to
up the chances that a search engine will link back to your page.</p>
<p>The last one, details, is combined with a summary tag. I&#39;m going to
click the arrow and see that it opens and closes. The default is to have
it closed and then open up when someone clicks on the little arrow
icon.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 198. list of inline tags (136) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image198.png" 
  title="List of inline tags" 
  alt="List of inline tags." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s go back to some other tags that aren&#39;t <strong>block</strong>
tags. These are inline tags. Again remember, inline tags means you can
put it into the page and go all in a line one after the other. You don&#39;t
need to break things up. <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> was the original
inline tag for plain text. You would put span around some code, and then
you could style it any way you wanted to.</p>
<p>In addition, we have <strong>&lt;cite&gt;</strong>,
<strong>&lt;abbr&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>,
<strong>&lt;code&gt;</strong> and then the <strong>&lt;sub&gt;</strong>
and the <strong>&lt;sup&gt;</strong>. Now, if you are watching closely
you may have noticed I left a typo after abbreviation there. So make
sure you put in the greater than sign. Let&#39;s look at examples of this
code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 199. inline elements; cite and abbr (137) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image199.png" 
  title="Inline elements; cite and abbr" 
  alt="Inline elements; cite and abbr." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Here I have my inline elements. The <strong>&lt;cite&gt;</strong>
basically makes it easier for people or bots to search your code, so I
put this code right inside a <strong>&lt;cite&gt;</strong> tag. Now,
again, this particular browser happened to style it differently, but
that&#39;s not always going to be the case.</p>
<p>Another new tag that has come along recently is the
<strong>&lt;abbr&gt;</strong> tag. If you notice, right along here, I&#39;ve
included abbreviation inside the box.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 200. example, title tag (137) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image200.png" 
  title="Example, title tag" 
  alt="Example, title tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Now, if you can, watch what happens when I put my mouse over the
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. As I hover over it, it&#39;s very small probably
on your screen, but you can see that the expanded version of the
abbreviation pops up, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Now, from an
accessibility screen point, it can actually read the expanded version.
But even for people who aren&#39;t using screen readers, I actually find
that you need to do something to let people know that hovering over is
an option. Most people wouldn&#39;t think about that.</p>
<p>The <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong> attribute is another one that is
just inline and most of us won&#39;t even know it&#39;s there but it allows you
to give extra semantic meaning. So the party starts at 9 PM. It makes
perfect sense to us, but the party took place on New Year&#39;s Eve. Notice
again, that&#39;s actually a time, even though it&#39;s not our typical numeric
time, it is a time. By putting in different time tags, it&#39;s also more
likely that if someone is accessing your site on a mobile phone, it&#39;ll
pop up as knowing that it&#39;s a date.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 201. tags; code, sub and sup (138) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image201.png" 
  title="Tags; code, sub and sup" 
  alt="Tags; code, sub and sup." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Sometimes you would like to be able to identify parts of your code as
code fragments. This happens to me all the time because I&#39;m a computer
scientist. So the <strong>&lt;code&gt;</strong> elements tend to be
displayed in different font but it&#39;s not always the case. But
<strong>&lt;code&gt;</strong> is just a nice way to break it up and let
people know what is this crazy stuff people are typing? Oh, it&#39;s code.
It&#39;s not supposed to make sense.</p>
<p>Finally, the last two are <strong>&lt;sub&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;sup&gt;</strong>, and these are used to create, a lot of
times, mathematical formulas. You can see here, I&#39;ve raised up the
three, and I&#39;ve lowered down the two. I&#39;ve given you the general
<strong>block</strong> tags, the general in-line tags that people use.
And there&#39;s other tags that people use quite often that you may see when
you&#39;re looking at their pages. The issue with these tags is the thing
when I say need more. It&#39;s really weird to use these tags unless you&#39;re
also incorporating them with JavaScript or some other elements that you
probably don&#39;t know a lot with yet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 202. tags that need 'more' (139) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image202.png" 
  title="List of tags that need &#39;more&#39;" 
  alt="List of tags that need &#39;more&#39;." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />


<p>These include the <strong>&lt;button&gt;</strong>, the
<strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;progress&gt;</strong>,
<strong>&lt;iframe&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;bdo&gt;</strong>, which
stands for bidirectional orientation, and then the
<strong>&lt;map&gt;</strong> attributes along with
<strong>&lt;area&gt;</strong>. Now, people really like these, but they
tend to need JavaScript. So I&#39;m gonna show you a quick example. But I&#39;m
not going to include the fancy add-ons you would need to use then.
That&#39;s not what this course is about. Right now, we&#39;re just learning
these tags.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 203. button, meter, progress & iframe (139) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image203.png" 
  title="Special tags; button, meter, progress &amp; iframe"
  alt="Special tags; button, meter, progress &amp; iframe."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />


<p>Let&#39;s take a look at them so you can see what they look like visually
and understand that they&#39;re not actually functioning yet. My special
tags that need more, I called it. Little word that you might not even be
able to see it because it&#39;s so light in screen but you can see I&#39;ve
included some open and close buttons. They don&#39;t do anything but they
look really nice. So go ahead and put them in if you want but it may
confuse people that there not actually operational.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 203. meter tag (140) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image203.png" 
  title="meter tag" 
  alt="meter tag." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The next one is <strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong>, and you&#39;ve probably
seen this before. Basically how this one works, let me actually bring up
the code for this one. You can see for the
<strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong> one I&#39;ve actually gone in here and put in
<strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong> minimum value of zero, maximum value of
100, and my current value is 50. So you can see it&#39;s colored in until
about half way through all right? Same here with the next one, I&#39;ve set
it to 25%. Here I just want to show you that it doesn&#39;t always have to
be 0 to 100. You can start at 5 and go to 10, and I&#39;ve set it to 8,
which is 60%. That&#39;s how the <strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong> works.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 204. special tags; button, meter, progress (140) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image204.png" 
  title="Special tags; button, meter and progress"
  alt="Special tags; button, meter and progress."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p><strong>&lt;progress&gt;</strong> is very similar to
<strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong> in that it shows kind of a proportional
value. Now, with <strong>&lt;progress&gt;</strong>, you&#39;re expecting
that you&#39;re doing something where eventually you&#39;ll get to 100. So
you&#39;ve taken the surveys before where as you filled in, the progress bar
fills in. Again both <strong>&lt;meter&gt;</strong> and
<strong>&lt;progress&gt;</strong> tend to use JavaScript to update
them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 205. iframe - content nesting (141) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image205.png" 
  title="iframe for content nesting" 
  alt="iframe for content nesting." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The next one I was going to show you is
<strong>&lt;iframe&gt;</strong>. <strong>&lt;iframe&gt;</strong> is used
to nest content in each other. It is not equally well supported by all
the browsers, so you want to explore who can use it and the best way to
use it. And you would want to look into options, such as height and
width.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 206. iframe is used to nest content (141) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image206.png" 
  title="The iframe is used to nest content" 
  alt="The iframe is used to nest content." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Right here in my <strong>iframe</strong>, I&#39;ve said hey, let&#39;s link
back to my page. And it puts my whole web page inside this little block
of the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 207. iframe; webpage within a webpage (142) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image207.png" 
  title="iframe; webpage within a webpage" 
  alt="iframe; webpage within a webpage." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Down here, I went ahead and said hey, let&#39;s do that iframe again, but
this time let&#39;s go ahead and have it take up a much bigger width, all
right? Now, one thing to notice is I can still click in here. I can do
all the things. It&#39;s as if I have a webpage inside of a webpage.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 208. bdo; bidirectional orientation (142) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image208.png" 
  title="BDO; Bidirectional Orientation" 
  alt="BDO; Bidirectional Orientation." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The last one. Let&#39;s go down here. I want to show you is the
<strong>bidirectional orientation</strong>. And this one would be
something you would use if your particular language tends to not just go
from left to right and instead goes right to left. So bidirectional
orientation takes either rtl which stands for right to left or ltr which
stands for left to right. And you can go ahead and put in the text. So
here is my going from left to right and here&#39;s that same thing going
right to left. I didn&#39;t really give examples of the map with the area.
Because, again, this is one where you would really need to understand
JavaScript to really embrace what it&#39;s doing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 209. review; useful tags (143) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image209.png" 
  title="Review; Useful Tags" 
  alt="Review; Useful Tags." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I realize I went over a lot of tags with you just right now. And some
of the code, you probably understood and some of it, you didn&#39;t. But all
of the code is online, so you can download it, you can play with it, you
can change it. But as you code, you&#39;re not supposed to go in and be
like, oh, I&#39;m going to try to use every possible tag I can to show how
much I know about HTML. No, use the most specific tag possible. Whenever
you&#39;re not sure ask somebody else say what would happen if I were trying
to look at this page with my eyes closed, what I understand what&#39;s going
on?</p>
<p>The second thing you need to understand is that sometimes your tags
just don&#39;t work. Now, there are two reasons that your tags may or may
not work. The first one might just be that you have a syntax error. So,
make sure you run your code through a validator, and that will help you
find places where you haven&#39;t closed tags. This is especially important
if you nest tags, meaning you put one inside the other.</p>
<p>The other thing you really want to do, is you want to run your code
in multiple browsers. Even if your page looks great when you&#39;re running
it in Chrome, make sure you check it out on Firefox. If it looks great
on Safari, make sure you check it on Chrome. It&#39;s important that you
make sure that your pages can be reachable to the greatest number of
people possible. And really, the only way you can do this is by keeping
your code simple, succinct, and you&#39;re always validating. Thanks.</p>

  title="3.01 Accessibility" 
  alt="3.01 Accessibility." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>One of the things that I&#39;m constantly talking about in my courses is
accessibility. The things is that I&#39;ve come to realize is that I can
talk about this as much as I want but it&#39;s really up to me to show to
you why it&#39;s so important for you to make the Web as accessible as
possible for others.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 211. accessibility goals (145) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image211.png" 
  title="Accessibility Goals"
  alt="Accessibility Goals."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about three things. First, I would like to
explain what a Web accessibility professional does. Second, we&#39;re going
to talk in-depth about how disabilities relate to the Web. Finally, I am
going to introduce for the first time the four principles of accessible
interface design. These four principles are something that will
hopefully guide you throughout the entire time you&#39;re making Web
pages.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start off with this whole idea of what a Web accessibility
coordinator does. One of my pet peeves is people who say they don&#39;t
wanna go into technology because they&#39;d rather do something where they
can help people. Well, my follow-through to that is that, if you really
want to help people, you need to understand technology. One of the
things that people like to do is find careers where they can help people
who have issues, and work together with people who are in technology.
And that&#39;s exactly the type of thing a Web accessibility coordinator
will do.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 212. what does a 'web accessibility coordinator' do? (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image212.png" 
  title="What does a &#39;Web Accessibility Coordinator&#39; do?" 
  alt="What does a &#39;Web Accessibility Coordinator&#39; do?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>First, one thing they might do is help guide policy and purchasing
decisions, on what kind of software is most accessible to the widest
range of people. Second, they can evaluate Web interfaces for
accessibility. By learning some key tips and tricks they can go to
different pages and find out where there might be pitfalls for people.
Third, they can assist people with disabilities to access online
infrastructure. Most universities and large companies will always have
someone, whose job it is to assist those who need some help accessing
online material. Or really, any type of technological tools. Fourth,
it&#39;s very important that people keep pace with changing technology. You
will always have a job if you can find a way to combine your love with
helping people with the different tools that are being used. Let&#39;s talk
specifics.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 213. 1 in 5 people have a disability (147) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image213.png" 
  title="1 in 5 people have a disability" 
  alt="1 in 5 people have disability." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>According to the 2012 U.S. Census, 1 in 5 people in the U.S. have a
disability. That means that there are 60 million people in the U.S. who
are dealing with issues that other people may not have. And half of them
are impeded from using the Internet. So we will talk briefly about four
issues that tend to pop up the most when dealing with disabilities and
the Internet. Visual issues, hearing, motor and cognitive.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 214. visual disabilities (147) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image214.png" 
  title="Visual Disabilities" 
  alt="Visual Disabilities." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>When you talk about accessibility almost everyone thinks about screen
readers. They design and say, oh I&#39;m gonna make sure that my page will
read well on a screen reader. However, it&#39;s much much more than that.
While 1.8 million people are completely blind, we also have 8 million
people who have difficulty reading ordinary newsprint even with their
glasses on. So one of the things that we want to think about when we&#39;re
designing is more than just font size, we also need to think about color
contrast. Your different font style. Can someone really see your page as
easily as possible?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 215. hearing disabilities (148) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image215.png" 
  title="Hearing Disabilities" 
  alt="Hearing Disabilities." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>We also want to think about hearing disabilities. We&#39;re talking about
from partial to total deafness. So 8 million people have difficulty
hearing in normal conversation and 1 million are completely deaf. More
and more places are moving to online presence and of course we all know
that watching videos online is a very common thing. We&#39;re all doing it
right now. So one of the things to think about if you decide to add
videos to your site is did you include the close captioning to really
make sure as many people as possible can access your content? But
there&#39;s also other things to think about. Are you blaring music? You
might have users who don&#39;t even realize that music is playing. Or
perhaps you have things so low that people can&#39;t quite grasp what you&#39;re
saying.</p>
<p>One of the things we&#39;re gonna talk about is making sure that people
have the ability to control the different multimedia that you&#39;re gonna
put on your page. This is going to help people with hearing disabilities
feel that they are in command of the technology, not that the
technology&#39;s in command of them.</p>

<p>One of my own personal issues is that of motor disabilities. There
are many, many people who are unable to use a mouse or a physical
keyboard. Maybe they have slow response time or just limited fine motor
skills. So dexterity issues are something that affects 8 million people
who have difficulty using their arms or hands. But my guess is that for
most of us have had some issue with trying to use the Web, and haven&#39;t
been quite able to do what we hope to do.</p>
<p>One issue that we talked about is what happens when someone tries to
tab through your page. This is a very common way for people to get
through pages. But unless you&#39;re very careful you can make it that
people tab through to nowhere. Another issue is do you require a steady
hand? Many people like to add flashy and cool graphics and animations to
the their page. But I know that I personally have been frustrated at
trying to click a button while the button keeps moving around the
screen.</p>

<p>Another issue is cognitive disabilities and when we talk about
cognitive disabilities, there&#39;s a very wide range of issues we might be
talking about. There&#39;s learning disabilities, distractibility, dyslexia.
Even the ability to remember or focus on large amounts of
information.</p>
<p>Some of the things I was laughing at when I looked at this slide just
now is that this slide, perhaps, has too much text on it for people to
be able to focus on what they’re looking at. We&#39;re saying that there are
16 million adults with ADD or ADHD.</p>
<p>Another overlooked population is that there are a large number of
soldiers, Marines, and National Guard members who have different
psychological conditions such as Traumatic Brain Injury, or
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Now what does that have to do with
making your Web accessible? We want to make sure that things are easy to
understand, not flashing, not requiring great amounts of concentration.
Cognitive disabilities number greater than physical and perceptual
disabilities combined. So it&#39;s something that you want to think about
when you&#39;re designing your page, or even if you&#39;re just help other
people design theirs.</p>

  alt="More Stats on Accessibility." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s get the specific stats because nothing helps me convince people
more that they want to design for the Web than showing them the numbers.
Almost 10% of the U.S. population has two or more disabilities. 40
thousand people in the U.S. are both deaf and blind. Think about trying
to access technology when you have those types of issues. 41% of adults
65 and older have a disability. And there are almost 9 million people
with disabilities who are poor. 70% of the disabled are underemployed or
unemployed. The issue is not that they are not able to do the jobs that
are out there. Many times there are roadblocks put up there that they
can&#39;t get through in order to do jobs that they are very well qualified
for.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The Web offers unprecedented opportunities for the disabled. Here we
are right now all taking a class online. Education has the benefit in
that we teachers can reach as many people as we can. And for students,
it means that you have access to resources that you never had before.
Many people get their news from online resources so we want to make sure
that we make it available to everybody.</p>
<p>Commerce I find particularly interesting because many places have
online presences but are they even realizing that they&#39;re alienating
such a large customer base? And of course the social benefits of the Web
are easy to see, so many people have created more friends online than
they actually have in real life. The benefits of the Web are amplified
for the disabled. People who before could not access education, news,
commerce or social interaction, are now able to do that. The Web is an
enabling technology and we want to make sure that we continue to make it
so.</p>

<p>Hopefully I convinced you just from a human standpoint that it&#39;s
important to make your Web pages accessible, but there are of course
legal aspects as well. The Department of Justice is in the process of
updating the American with Disabilities Act to include online resources
of state and local entities. What this means is that universities, state
governments, local governments all need to make sure that the
information they have online is accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>There are many instances of case law where individuals or groups have
filed civil complaints against universities, companies because they feel
that their products are not accessible to people in a way that it should
be.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s just review this for a second. What is Web accessibility? What
it is is making sure that you&#39;re making your Web accessible for the
widest possible audience, this includes people with permanent
disabilities and those with temporary disabilities.</p>
<p>Currently, the online infrastructure, while a wonderful resource, is
hostile to those with disabilities. Another issue you want to think
about is that accessibility is inseparable from Search Engine
Optimization, mobile technology, and usability. Improve one of these
things and you can improve all the others. So what&#39;s the best way to
accomplish accessibility? It&#39;s adherence to standards.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>As you start now, you&#39;re at the very beginning of your Web career.
It&#39;s the perfect time for you to learn the best possible tags and the
best possible ways to make your page accessible. These standards are
going to come from the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, called
WCAG. And these guidelines are principle, not technology based. What
this means is that you don&#39;t need to go out and find the greatest
language or greatest technology to make your page accessible, instead
you really just need to follow four principles as you design your sites.
Is my site perceivable, is it operable, is it understandable, and is it
robust? We&#39;ll be talking about these four principles throughout our
entire course.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s review quickly. I know that right now you&#39;re starting your Web
design career, and it can be overwhelming. But I&#39;m hoping that one of
the things you&#39;ll make sure that you do is design with accessibility in
mind. It is the right thing to do for so many reasons. Whether it&#39;s
because you want to reach out to the largest customer base you can, or
because legally it&#39;s required. The important thing is make sure you do
it. And the great thing is accessible design is actually pretty straight
forward.</p>
<p>All you need to do is adhere to standards. The reason that many pages
are inaccessible, is because they&#39;re trying to be flashy and cool and do
things that aren&#39;t quite yet fully implemented to standards. Finally as
we go through this class make sure that you pay special attention to the
semantics behind HTML tags. These semantics contain special information
that are going to make it much easier for people who are using assistive
devices to understand the content of your page. Together we can make
sure that the next generation of Web developers are designing for the
greatest possible audience.</p>

<p>In the Week One material you may or may not have run the test at <a href="https://html5test.com/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>https://html5test.com/</strong></a>
to see how well your browser supports HTML5. But you should also find
out if that HTML5 is easily usable by people who rely on assistive
technology without having to use special work-arounds. </p>
<p>In the screenshot below I compared my current Chrome browser (528) vs
Firefox (497), Edge (496), Safari (477), and even Chrome on an older
machine (499).</p>
<p>The site <a href="https://html5accessibility.com/"

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I know that I&#39;ve been saying validate your code over and over again,
but let&#39;s talk about why it&#39;s so important.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 227. why validate? (156) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image227.png" 
  title="Why Validate?" 
  alt="Why Validate?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Browsers are basically the helicopter parents of programming. You can
put in so many mistakes, but the browser is going to say, &#39;“it&#39;s okay. I
know that you meant to close that tag.&#39;” &#39;“I know that you meant to call
that tag footer instead of foot or main instead of min.&#39;” And so it goes
in and it makes the site, quote, unquote, look, &#39;“okay.&#39;” However, as
your pages become more complex and you&#39;re adding more and more tags, and
eventually maybe even adding CSS and JavaScript. Those little hidden
areas where you have bad code, can be absolutely devastating to
accessibility tools because they don&#39;t know what to do with that broken
code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 228. three approaches to validation (156) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image228.png" 
  title="Three Approaches to Validation" 
  alt="Three Approaches to Validation." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>There are basically three approaches to using a syntactic
accessibility checker. That wave W3. The first is that you can validate
by a <strong>URI</strong>, which is a fancy term for
<strong>URL</strong>. In order to use that option, your site must be
hosted somewhere. So if you&#39;re using <strong>Replit</strong>, you can
use your <strong>URL</strong>. If you are doing accessibility work for
your job, you can use the public facing website that they use.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people like to do what we call validate by file name. So
if you click that option, you&#39;ll click on the button, it&#39;ll let you
upload the file, and it can check it that way. I rarely use that one
personally because I feel like it&#39;s too easy to upload the wrong file
and not notice.</p>
<p>My own personal favorite is to validate by direct input, where you
copy the entire HTML file and put it in so it can check it line by line
for you to see just if you&#39;ve made some little mistakes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 229. don't freak out! (157) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image229.png" 
  title="Don't Freak Out!" 
  alt="Don't Freak Out!" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>When you do this, just relax, alright? Because more than likely,
you&#39;re going to see so many errors, right? You might have a 15-20 line
web page. How in the heck did it generate 52 errors, right? It doesn&#39;t
make sense. The thing is, one little error at the top can propagate and
cause a lot of other not real errors as you go down. So when you run it
through the checker, always start at the top. Find that first error, fix
that error, run the validator again.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t exactly figure out how to fix it, well, hey, it&#39;s the
Internet, right? You can search for solutions online and in forums.
Usually your best bet is to just copy and paste that error and put it
into the search bar, okay? You can do it.</p>

  title="wave.webaim.org - Accessibility Validation" 
  alt="wave.webaim.org - Accessibility Validation." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>In addition to syntactical validation, we also want to talk about
accessibility validation. I&#39;m a big fan of the wave.webaim.org site. To
validate the accessibility of your page, you can put your
<strong>URL</strong> directly in, or if you don&#39;t have a
<strong>URL</strong> yet, right, maybe you&#39;re still in production. Maybe
you&#39;re using Visual Studio Code. You can install an extension to check
your local pages, right? The ones that start with
&#39;“<strong>File</strong>&#39;” instead of &#39;“<strong>http</strong>.&#39;”</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to talk about other accessibility validators as we go
through, but it&#39;s very important that you do these two steps at the very
least. To make sure that you are creating a page that works for
everyone, not just somebody who&#39;s using the same browser you are, such
as Chrome or Firefox. People might be using screen readers, they might
be using Braille readers. There are so many different options out there.
It&#39;s really pretty exciting if you take the time to look at what people
are using.</p>

<p>Finally important thing to know is that validated sites are more
robust and they&#39;re more accessible. More robust means they&#39;re less
likely to break.</p>

<h3>3.02 Putting Your Code Out on to the Web</h3>

<p>The lesson in this next section is intended for those students who
want to post their websites to the Web. Until now you have been viewing
your files <strong><em>locally</em></strong>. This means that the
browser isn&#39;t sending a Request to a server, but rather just retrieving
a file from your computer. (This is why the protocol in the address bar
is <strong>file</strong>, not <strong>http</strong>.) So go ahead and
read the &#39;“Hosting Your Site&#39;” lesson (3.03) but feel free to skip the
lectures on <strong>Replit</strong> and <strong>Github Pages</strong> if
you don&#39;t plan on hosting your files on the web. You can always change
your mind and host them later.</p>

  title="3.03 Hosting Your Site" 
  alt="3.03 Hosting Your Site." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi, everybody. Today we&#39;re going to talk about hosting your site. And
what I mean by hosting your site is how you take the pages that you&#39;ve
been working on so far and put them up on the Internet for everyone else
to see them. In order to host your site, you need two things. You need,
first, a domain name. That&#39;s the name that people look at in your
<strong>URL</strong>. The second thing you need is a hosting company,
usually called a hosting service, and they are going to be the ones who
act as the server for your files to let other people see them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 233. domain names (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image233.png" 
  title="Domain Names"
  alt="Domain Names."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So first, let&#39;s talk about domain names. Usually when you go to buy a
domain name, you&#39;re going to purchase it for multiple years at a time,
because it really doesn&#39;t make that much sense to own your domain name
for only a single year. Unless, of course, maybe you&#39;re running for an
election or doing something where you know you only want it up for a
short time.</p>
<p>The most common domain names have the domain ending of .com, but more
and more, the other extensions are gaining acceptance. So if you go to
buy a domain name and the only way you can get the name you really want
is to use <strong>.net</strong> or <strong>.biz</strong>, that&#39;s okay. I
recommend that you still go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>The important thing to know is that domain names by themselves,
they&#39;re pretty much useless. You can own it, but unless you have files
there that people can look at, no one&#39;s going to be able to go there and
see anything. This is where the hosting services come in. If you were to
look at your <strong>URL</strong> right now on your page, when you make
a file and you right click and you&#39;re looking at your site in Chrome or
Internet Explorer or anything like that, you&#39;re probably going to notice
that the protocol is &#39;“file.&#39;” We don&#39;t want that. We don&#39;t want it to
be &#39;“file,&#39;” or &#39;“C:&#39;” or &#39;“My Documents.&#39;” We want it to be something
that looks like www, and that&#39;s where the hosting company comes in.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 234. hosting (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image234.png" 
  title="Hosting" 
  alt="Hosting" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>What you need is a registered <strong>IP address</strong> to connect
your domain name with the Internet. Hosting services are going to vary.
They go from free, to what I call mid-range, to full-service. And so you
need to decide what kind of hosting service best fits you. To be honest,
I usually recommend free when you&#39;re getting started, and then make your
way up. But let&#39;s talk about the pros and cons of each one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 235. free services (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image235.png" 
  title="Free services"
  alt="Free services."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>With free services, you really have little or no control over your
domain name. So if you go and look at some other people&#39;s, particularly
from your school, your work, things where people are not really there
just for the domain name is you&#39;re going to see things like wix dot
whatever dot whatever, and then your name.</p>
<p>You&#39;re going to have limited tools. Sometimes when you pay for a
site, you&#39;re going to be able to have email registration, different
things like that. Free services don&#39;t want to give you too much freedom
because they&#39;re a little worried about what you&#39;re going to do.</p>
<p>Probably the worst part about free services is that there&#39;s a lot of
advertising and redirects. If somebody goes to your site and makes the
smallest little typo, rather than getting a nice friendly warning,
they&#39;re probably going to be redirected to somebody trying to sell
something.</p>
<p>The nice part about free services is that they have a very familiar
look and feel across all of them. If you sign up for one service and
learn how to do your hosting on it, you can pretty much rest assured
that you&#39;re going to be able to manipulate your files on any other free
service as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 236. paid services (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image236.png" 
  title="Paid services" 
  alt="Paid services." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>So let&#39;s talk about paid services, both the mid-range and the full.
With paid services, you tend to have much better tools for manipulating
your code. It&#39;s not just about putting your files up on the web. You can
do things like have email filters, send out special, what we call cron
jobs.</p>
<p>Cron jobs are different files that you can run at different times of
the day. So if you want to have a database, you want to have a list
server, you want to have emails, then you might want to pay for the paid
services. The other really nice thing about paid services is that
there&#39;s technical support available to you. So you can go ahead and
email, chat, anything you need. You&#39;re not going to find that with the
free services, or just won&#39;t be quite as good.</p>
<p>But before you go for the paid services, I recommend you check for
free services through work or school as well. A lot of time these free
services still have the really great tools and the support, but you just
don&#39;t have to pay for them. I hope you&#39;re excited, and I hope you&#39;re
going to take that next step and that you want to go and post your work
out on the web. Good luck.</p>

<p>The first step is making a GitHub Pages account. I&#39;m going to go in
here and pick a username. As I type in, it&#39;s going to let me know if
somebody already has that one or not. I&#39;ve created web designer for
everyone. Make sure that whatever username you pick, makes sense because
this is going to be part of the <strong>URL</strong> for your site. Pick
something simple. Not a lot of upper or lowercase. Something that
describes why you&#39;re building your site. Go ahead and put in an email,
and a password.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve logged in, what you want to do is you want to create your

place where you put your code on the web. Think of it like making a
folder on your desktop. Maybe you&#39;ve made a folder called HTML where
you&#39;ve been putting all your files, this is the name of the folder that
we&#39;re going to put up on the web. It is important that you follow the
rules precisely.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 241. github, + new repository (165) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image241.png" 
  title="GitHub, + New repository" 
  alt="GitHub, + New repository." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The first thing I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to go up to the very top
right corner, and you&#39;ll see a plus. When you click on the plus, there&#39;s
something that says, &#39;“New Repository,&#39;” and this is a point where it&#39;s
going to stop and ask you to verify your email address. Once you verify
your email, it should bring you back to this page. So, I&#39;m going to try
clicking on the plus again and saying New Repository. All right. This is
where it&#39;s very important. This repository name has to be the same as
your account name. In my case, it&#39;s
&#39;“<strong>webdesigner4everyone.github.io</strong>.&#39;” In my description,
I can put something like &#39;“the website for web design for
everyone.&#39;”</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The second thing you want to make sure you do is click on this little
button down here that says, &#39;“Initialize this repository with a
README&#39;”. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m going to click &#39;“Create,&#39;” and it takes
sometimes a few seconds. Just to make me everyone can see that README
that I clicked on that I created, it automatically generate a site
called, &#39;“webdesigner4everyone.github.io.&#39;” I messed up. I need to
rename this because it was supposed to be, &#39;“Web.&#39;” Now, it&#39;s time to
check to see if I&#39;ve made a live website for everyone to see. I&#39;m going
to copy this link right here;
&#39;“<strong>webdesigner4everyone.github.io</strong>.&#39;” I&#39;m going to copy
it, and I am going to see what happens if we go here.</p>

  title="GitHub, new live lame website" 
  alt="GitHub, new live lame website." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Look, I actually have a website that&#39;s live to everyone. I didn&#39;t
have to pay for anything. I didn&#39;t have to sign up for anything and
GitHub Pages is generally accepted by everyone as a fairly secure place
to put your code.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&#39;t put any real code yet. I&#39;m going to cover that in a
separate lesson because I want to keep the two ideas separate; creating
your GitHub account which you only have to do once, and then uploading
your code to GitHub which you&#39;ll have to do multiple times. Now, just a
few notes. Take a few seconds between each step that I covered here.
GitHub can get very busy and sometimes it might take a few minutes for
something to happen between you clicking okay or accept or upload. But
hopefully, from here, you won&#39;t have too much problems. In the readings,
I&#39;ll include links to other places you can look for help in creating
your GitHub Pages account.</p>

  alt="3.04b Uploading to GitHub Pages." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve come up with a pretty nice site. I&#39;ve got one right
here. I&#39;m going to click on my &#39;“<strong>index.html</strong>&#39;” file, and
I&#39;ve got some images in it. I have a special file called CSS that you
might not be familiar with yet, but that&#39;s okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="GitHub, new website but not live." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>But let&#39;s just see what my site looks like. Here we go, up. Here is a
little page I made about me with a little bit of formatting. But if you
check and look in the upper corner, you can see that this site is not
live. The fact that it says, &#39;“file:,&#39;” so forward forward forward, I
can&#39;t share it with other people live. I can email them my code, I could
say to somebody, &#39;“Oh look, I made a web page,&#39;” and then I could send
them this file and all the images and everything like that, but that&#39;s
kind of a pain.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="GitHub, create 1st live website." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Let&#39;s make this site go live on my GitHub Pages account. First, go
back here, to my GitHub account which if you haven&#39;t created yet, that&#39;s
okay. I&#39;ve got another lesson. Go create your account and come back here
and meet up with us. But other than that, I&#39;m going to make my first
live account. Once again, I&#39;m going to go up and do a plus for a new
repository. Basically, consider a new folder full of code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Last time I needed to be very careful with my repository name, not
this time. I&#39;m just going to call this one, let&#39;s say &#39;“sample,&#39;” I try
very hard to keep it to all lowercase. You can include the little like
dash, but no special characters.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to click on, &#39;“Initialize this repository with a README,&#39;”
and I click on that, then &#39;“Create repository.&#39;”</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="GitHub website built." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>GitHub right now is creating a new site for me to upload my code.
Now, people who use GitHub for, I&#39;m going to say like real, are actually
doing a lot of things from command lines and they have to memorize a lot
of stuff. We&#39;re not doing that. We&#39;re just using GitHub Pages to host
our code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 249. github, choose & upload files (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="GitHub, choose &amp; upload files for website" 
  alt="GitHub, choose &amp; upload files for website." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Next, let&#39;s click on &#39;“Upload files.&#39;” Now, here&#39;s a tricky part, if
I were to click on &#39;“Choose your files,&#39;” I could do that and I could go
through and pick, well, you know I need this file and that one, but it
won&#39;t let me upload entire folders. See if I click on CSS and I click on
open, it&#39;s like, &#39;“Oh, is this the file you want?&#39;”, I don&#39;t want this,
I want everything, not just files. So, I clicked on &#39;“Add&#39;”.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 250. drag & drop whole website (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image250.png" 
  title="Drag &amp; drop whole website data sources" 
  alt="Drag &amp; drop whole website data sources." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>What I&#39;m going to do is go over here, and I&#39;m just going to go back
up, one, and I&#39;m going to drag this whole folder, and this is going to
let me upload as many files as I want.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 251. github pages, upload & commit (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="GitHub pages, upload web code, then commit at bottom of screen" 
  alt="GitHub pages, upload web code, then commit at bottom of screen." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The next mistake I make all the time is that I forget to go all the
way down to the bottom and say, &#39;“Commit changes.&#39;” This is the first
step out of two steps required to make your site go live. The first step
is just to upload your files. Again, this may take a few minutes to
complete.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 252. github, choose master branch (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="GitHub, choose master branch as GitHub pages source." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>While that&#39;s going on, I&#39;m going to go up, and I&#39;m going to click on
&#39;“Settings.&#39;” Alright. Now, what I need to do is to say, &#39;“Hey, if
somebody wants to see my site, I don&#39;t want them to see my code. I want
them to see my actual page.&#39;” I&#39;m going to scroll down, and I&#39;m looking
for a site that says, &#39;“GitHub pages.&#39;” Go to none and choose &#39;“master
branch&#39;” and &#39;“save.&#39;” Alright. You never really know if it worked or
not.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 253. github, your site is published (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="GitHub, your site is ready to be published." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to go back down to GitHub pages, it will now tell me,
&#39;“Hey, your code is now right here.&#39;” I&#39;m going to click on this, and
it&#39;s not uncommon for to say, &#39;“hey, you don&#39;t have anything yet&#39;” or
something like that. What I&#39;m going to do next is, go back to my code
and say, &#39;“Okay. What was the name of that folder I dragged up? Oh it
was sampler, and what was the name of my file?&#39;” Hopefully, it was
<strong>index.html</strong> and it is, great.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Sample, GitHub website." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Now, I&#39;m going to hit enter and there&#39;s my site. Alright. The two
steps for creating this GitHub account is to upload your file and then
change that kind of link for GitHub Pages to turn it on. After that, you
can upload as many things as you want. I am going to do one more thing
with you real quick though. I&#39;m going to go back to my GitHub account
and I&#39;m going to do this one more time but slightly different. I want to
go to github.com.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255. add repository without readme (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Create new repository without a README" 
  alt="Create new repository without a README." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to make one more repository. I&#39;m going to call this one,
&#39;“sample two,&#39;” and this time, I&#39;m going to forget and I&#39;m
<strong>[not]</strong> going to click on this README. We&#39;ll click on the
repository. Oh! Well, now there&#39;s no place for me to click on that
upload files, and you feel kind of stuck. If you forget, just scroll
right up to the README link on the page, and you click on it and it
creates the README. Just so you know, commit new file is the equivalent
of save files for what we do in our desktop. Now, I can upload
files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256. github pages, select master branch & commit (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image256.png" 
  title="GitHub pages, settings, add GitHub Pages master branch, commit/save" 
  alt="GitHub pages, settings, add GitHub Pages master branch, commit/save." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>I&#39;m going to do it one more time to show you another easier way. I&#39;m
going to go back here. Before I dragged the entire &#39;“sampler&#39;” folder,
this time I&#39;m just going to grab here. They&#39;re all uploading. I&#39;m going
to click on, &#39;“Commit Changes.&#39;” While this is happening, I want you to
think, &#39;“Alright, what was that second step? What was that next step she
said I had to do?&#39;” That step is to go into &#39;“settings&#39;” and add the
GitHub Pages. Let&#39;s go up to &#39;“settings.&#39;” Now, scroll down to &#39;“Master
branch&#39;” and &#39;“save,&#39;” and then since I want to be a little lazy, I&#39;m
just going to scroll down here again, and be like, &#39;“Oh great, here&#39;s
the link to my site.&#39;” I&#39;m going to click on it.</p>
<p>Again, when you get the 404 error, there&#39;s usually two reasons:
either you spelled something wrong which isn&#39;t the case here because we
clicked on it, we didn&#39;t type anything in. Or you need to give GitHub a
few more minutes to upload everything, or the third one is sometimes,
I&#39;m not exactly sure why, but sometimes, GitHub seems to almost forget
to look for &#39;“<strong>index.html</strong>&#39;” file. So, I&#39;ll hit
&#39;“Enter,&#39;” and there we go. GitHub Pages is a great free way for you to
host your code and share it with everyone who you think will be
impressed with your incredible work.</p>

<p>As we reach the end of this course, it&#39;s going to be time for you to
make your final project and share the things that you&#39;ve learned with
your fellow peers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Replit Example, Movies of the 80&#39;s." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>What I have here is an earlier, long ago example that we made with my
favorite movies from 80s, on <strong>Replit</strong>. If you remember,
on the left-hand side, we have the code as I&#39;m creating it. On the
right-hand side, we get to see this live version of the page, including
the <strong>URL</strong> that you can share with somebody if you want
them to see the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 259. url of replit example (175) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>What I&#39;m going to do is copy this URL and open up a new what&#39;s called
an incognito browser, right? It&#39;s Chrome, but it&#39;s Chrome that doesn&#39;t
know who I am, all right? I&#39;m not logged in and I&#39;m going to copy and
paste that <strong>URL</strong>. This is great that
<strong>Replit</strong> doesn&#39;t know who I am. It could be me, could be
my grandma, could be my third cousin.</p>

  title="Right-click, view page source" 
  alt="Right-click, view page source." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>If I wanted to see the code that created this page, technically I
could do a right-click and I could do &#39;“View Page Source,&#39;” and then I
could see the code that made up this page. But <strong>Replit</strong>
actually does it one better.</p>

<p>When you submit your code for grading, instead of submitting the link
to what we call the &#39;“deployed page,&#39;” let&#39;s go back to
<strong>Replit</strong>. And instead of sharing this link right here,
I&#39;m going to share the link that starts with
&#39;“<strong>replit.com</strong>,&#39;” alright? So instead of starting with my
file name, it&#39;s going to start with &#39;“<strong>replit.com</strong>,&#39;” and
let&#39;s see what it looks like when I share that link instead. Now, I can
still see the page and I can still run it, but it gives people the
option to actually show the code to see what you&#39;ve made. I&#39;m going to
click on &#39;“Show Code.&#39;” And now your peers, it&#39;s going to be easier for
them to see the files that you&#39;ve created and take a look and check your
code, right? They could, even if they&#39;d like, just so click on this
&#39;“fork&#39;” button and get their very own version of your code.</p>
<p>In this class, when you make a page in <strong>Replit</strong>, it&#39;s
great to share what we call your deployed page with your friends and
family. But when it comes time for you to submit a link for us to do the
grading of your work, and vice versa, make sure that you are sharing the
link that starts with &#39;“<strong>replit.com</strong>&#39;” instead of the one
that ends in &#39;“<strong>replit.co</strong>.&#39;” Don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t
quite remember this, you can jump on the forums. People will be there to
give you help. But we always want to give people the greatest chance
possible to look at your code and see how it&#39;s all working together,
good luck.</p>

<h3>3.05 Sharing Your Page from Replit</h3>

<p><strong>Replit</strong> is what we call an <strong>Integrated
Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>)– this is a fancy
term software that lets you do more than just edit your files. In this
case <strong>Replit</strong> lets you create a page AND host it so that
other people can see what you have created.</p>
<p><strong>Replit</strong> is free, and the first step is to make an
account.</p>

<h3>Congrats!</h3>

<p>A tutorial will pop up and I encourage you to look through it to find
out what the different parts of the <strong>IDE</strong> are. But for
now the important thing is that you should be able to find three things:
the Files section, the Coding Environment, and the View window.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 263. the files section (179) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image263.png" 
  title="The files section" 
  alt="The files section." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:20%" />

<h3>3.05 File Section</h3>

<p>The file section is located on the top left corner of the screen.
This is where you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>View all your files and file structure</p></li>
  <li><p>Create new files by selecting the new file button in the upper right side of 
    the file section. Name this new file and remember to use the correct file extension 
     (.html, .css, .js) – <strong>Replit</strong> will create a template based on this 
     extension.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create new folders by selecting the new folder button and naming your new folder</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.05 Coding Environment</h3>

<p>The coding environment is located in the middle of the screen and is where you can edit 
your code.</p>

  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<h3>3.05 View Window</h3>

<p>As you make changes you can click the run button and
<strong>Replit</strong> will display your <strong>index.html</strong>
file in the Webview area on the right hand side of the screen. This is
also where you can find the <strong>URL</strong> to share your site - it
will be a combination of your username and the project name you chose
when you created your repl.</p>

<h3>3.05 Final Project Description</h3>
<h3><strong>Specification</strong></h3>

<p>Your final project is to create and host your own website using <a href="https://replit.com/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Replit</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In previous versions of the course I asked students to make a very
specific webpage, but I invite you all to create a page of your choice,
you just need to make sure that you have the following components in
your project.</p>

<h3><strong>Grading Checklist</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Peer Grading</strong></p>
<p>For this assignment you will be grading the submission of your peers
and they will be grading your work as well.</p>
<p>Please note that you must get this COMPLETELY correct to receive
credit. You will get frustrated. You will put in silly mistakes. But
hang in there. And don&#39;t forget to reach out for help if you need
it.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 266. final project demo (3.06) (182) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image266.png" 
  title="3.06 Final Project Demo" 
  alt="3.06 Final Project Demo." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi everyone. Welcome to the Final Project. One of the things I&#39;ve
learned as a teacher is that it is so important for students to take
that time and create something on their own.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 267. final project (182) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image267.png" 
  title="Final Project" 
  alt="Final Project." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Today I&#39;m going to do a demo of what we would like you to do for the
final project. This demo, though, is just a guideline. What we really
want you to do is create a topic and content that&#39;s important to you or
interesting to you, or maybe something that you have to do for another
class. I don&#39;t mind double dipping. This final project is really about
you having that chance to do something unique. While I say that, there
are some requirements that we&#39;re going to have just to help you do some
grading.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 268. requirements, final project (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image268.png" 
  title="Requirements, Final Project" 
  alt="Requirements, Final Project." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Those requirements, of course, include creating a full page, and I
want that page to have all those things we&#39;ve been talking about this
entire class. You&#39;re going to start off, and I want you to have that doc
type that says, &#39;“I code in HTML5.&#39;” You&#39;re going to have the header,
you&#39;ll have your metadata, and the body. Inside the body, make sure that
you&#39;re using some semantic tags. At a minimum, we want you to include an
<strong>h1</strong> tag and a main tag. Include a list with at least
three items. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s an unordered list or an ordered list.
Do whatever you would like. And of course, because it always makes
things a little bit more interesting, when we have some visual
components, I want you to include at least three images.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re going to start off, you&#39;re going to code, you&#39;re going to
add things, you&#39;re going to make some mistakes, and it&#39;s going to look
really great. That&#39;s when I want you to stop. And if you haven&#39;t
already, you need to go in and validate your site. Validation is so
important for accessibility. When you have everything looking the way
you want it to, you&#39;re going to host and share your site not only so
that your friends and family can see it but also so that your peers in
this course can give you a review.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come up with three examples, and I&#39;m really hoping that these
will inspire you to make something unique or even inspire you to say,
mine is not going to look like that at all.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 269. final project, demo one (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image269.png" 
  title="Final Project, Demo One" 
  alt="Final Project, Demo One." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>Example one is, of course, the University of Michigan. Go blue! You
can see near the top that I have the Go Blue title. We have the
University of Michigan <strong>h1</strong>. I have actually quite a few
different headings you can see as we go through. I have an unordered
list with some of our famous alumni. We also have an ordered list of the
different universities rankings.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 270/271. final project, demo one sample screens (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image270.png" 
  title="Final Project, Demo Sample One, Quick Facts/Gallery" 
  alt="Final Project, Demo Sample One, Quick Facts/Gallery." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />
<img src="./images/image271.png" 
  title="Final Project, Demo Sample One, Quick Facts/Gallery - Back to Top" 
  alt="Final Project, Demo Sample One, Quick Facts/Gallery - Back to Top." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:45%" />

<p>Hopefully, if you can see this, as I put my mouse over it, you can
see that this is a link. And as I continue to go through, you can see
I&#39;ve included at least three images and something down at the very
bottom that says &#39;“back to top.&#39;”</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 272. final project, demo two (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image272.png" 
  title="Final Project, Demo Sample Two" 
  alt="Final Project, Demo Sample Two." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>In our second example, we&#39;ve focused on images and on links and on
list items. I have here a site with the five best movies of all time.
Each one of these movies you can get to with your mouse, or you can get
to it by clicking on a link, which is great for accessibility. These
images are embedded inside of a list. So you can see right here so it
looks very different, but it still fulfills all of the requirements.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 273. final project, demo three (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image273.png" 
  title="Final Project, Demo Sample Three" 
  alt="Final Project, Demo Sample Three." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:50%" />

<p>The third example is from one of my tech loving students where they
went in and compared Apples and Windows laptops. In this case, they
included an unordered list where we include all of the different
attributes and an image for each one. You might be wondering what this
&#39;“skip to main content&#39;” link is that has been appearing on each one of
our pages. It&#39;s not required, but it&#39;s something I always encourage
because it helps for accessibility. If you have a really big page, or
perhaps, I&#39;m going to show you right here, you&#39;ve zoomed in. You can
always use this &#39;“skip to main content&#39;” to jump down to the main part
of your page. All right, so I have here, again our three different
examples, and we are not looking for something that looks exactly like
this.</p>

<p>What we are looking for is your ability to go back, look at some of
the things we&#39;ve done so far, and make something your own.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 274. validate your site (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image274.png" 
  title="Validate Your Site" 
  alt="Validate Your Site." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>I mentioned earlier that it&#39;s very important to validate your site.
We expect you to use, at a minimum, the W3 validator to check your
syntax, and the WAVE validator from WebAIM to check for
accessibility.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 275. share your site (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image275.png" 
  title="Share Your Site" 
  alt="Share Your Site." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>The best part about making a website is sharing your website. So if
you&#39;re using <strong>Replit</strong>, it&#39;s pretty easy for you to share
your site using the same steps we&#39;ve been using in this class. If you&#39;re
using something other than <strong>Replit</strong>, you can still
utilize some of the lessons from this course to learn about other ways
to host and share your site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 276. peer reviews (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image276.png" 
  title="Peer Reviews" 
  alt="Peer Reviews." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>However, it&#39;s very important that you have a way to share your site
so that the peer reviews can be done successfully. You will need to do
at least three peer reviews to receive credit for this assignment. The
expectation is that everyone will participate, but if you are not a paid
learner and you would still like to get feedback, consider putting your
link to your site in a forum. And I hope people will help each other out
and give each other great feedback.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m super proud of you for making it this far in the class.
And this project is not supposed to be something where we&#39;re going to
grade you or judge you harshly. This is just a celebration of you
learning something new and taking that time to learn about HTML, the web
accessibility and just tech in general. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Congratulations!</h3>

<p>Well done on taking the leap and learning more about the way web
pages are created and transferred across the Internet. If you enjoyed
this course and would like to take the next step you may be wondering
where to go. This course is the first course in the Web Design for
Everybody Specialization offered by Coursera. The other courses in this
specialization include:</p>

<h3>Coursera&#39;s Introduction to CSS3</h3>

<p>In this course you will take simple HTML documents and use Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) to make them look less like they are from 1992 and
more like the beautiful, well-designed sites you see today. All of the
major aspects of styling will be covered, while still maintaining our
focus on accessibility. In fact, designing with accessibility in mind
takes on even greater importance since many people ignore the core
principles and tend to use color, images, and font to convey information
instead of using semantic tags.</p>

<h3>Coursera&#39;s Interactivity with JavaScript</h3>

<p>Ever notice how some pages react to mouse clicks, screen swipes, or
information you type into forms? This is often done using the JavaScript
programming language. This course offers you an overview of the
techniques and best practices for adding interaction to your site.</p>

<h3>Coursera&#39;s Advanced Styling with Responsive Design</h3>

<p>Responsive design is the ability to design a site with multiple
screen sizes (or &#39;“platforms&#39;”) in mind. We have all been to a site that
doesn&#39;t really work from a mobile device, or other sites that waste
space by using small text on a big screen. In this course you will learn
to design your site to automatically respond to the platform it is
viewed on. Techniques include determining specific screen sizes
yourself, or using popular template platforms such as Bootstrap to
handle the responsive aspects for you.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch3-07">3.07 Closing (3:54)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 277. closing (3.07) (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image277.png" 
  title="3.07 Closing" 
  alt="3.07 Closing." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Hi everybody. I&#39;m not sure if I should say welcome back or goodbye.
Because this is the end of the class. I know that you might be a little
bit surprised like, what that&#39;s it? I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m ready to be a
web developer yet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 278. wait what? that's it? (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image278.png" 
  title="Wait what? That&#39;s it?" 
  alt="Wait what? That&#39;s it?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Well I&#39;m here to tell you, you&#39;re not ready to be a web developer.
But what you have learned is that with the exception of a few things
called forms and a little bit about graphics, you have learned the bulk
of the HTML5 tags. You&#39;ve learned their syntax and their semantics. With
that information, you are now ready to go off and learn even more about
the areas that really interest you in particular. Whether that&#39;s design,
accessibility, user experience. And it&#39;s very important that you have
this basic understanding before you go onto these other ideas.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 279. edit/view files and code (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image279.png" 
  title="Edit/View Files and Code" 
  alt="Edit/View Files and Code." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Let&#39;s think about some of the things you&#39;ve learned. One of the first
tools that&#39;s now in your toolbox is that you can view and edit code,
which is something a lot of people have difficulty with. You can use
that editor to modify an existing HTML file. You can create one from
scratch. There&#39;s a lot of different things that you can do using the
editors that you&#39;ve now mastered.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 280. evaluate accessibility (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image280.png" 
  title="Evaluate Accessibility" 
  alt="Evaluate Accessibility." 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>You also know the different options for opening a file. I&#39;m not sure
if you remember, but just a few short weeks ago when you saw an HTML
file, probably the only thing you could do was open it in a browser. Now
you know how to do many more things than that. You also are at the very
beginning of learning how to evaluate for accessibility. From the first
step of viewing other people&#39;s source code and looking for those
semantic tags, you know the importance that these tags have for people
who want to access your page.</p>

<p>You also have the ability to go to the validator.org to check for
well-structured syntactic code. Or to go to WebAIM to check for that
semantic structure that people may or may not be using in their code.
Again, the ability to evaluate accessibility is something that we need
more and more people to know.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 281. publish site (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image281.png" 
  title="Publish Site"
  alt="Publish Site."
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>Finally, you also, hopefully, know how to publish your site or at the
very least, you know the basics if you do decide to publish in the
future. You know about domain names, you know about hosting, and you
know that you really don&#39;t want to buy that one domain name they keep
trying to sell you in the Super Bowl unless you&#39;re also willing to buy a
host. You&#39;ve also achieved some familiarity, no matter how small, with
so many systems that are out there. You&#39;ve learned about cPanel, you&#39;ve
learned about FTP, you&#39;ve learned about different browsers, and you&#39;ve
learned about different types of editors. And this is all information
you can use to expand your knowledge in other areas.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 282. what next? (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img src="./images/image282.png" 
  title="What next?" 
  alt="What next?" 
  style="border: 2px solid #000000; width:40%" />

<p>What should you do next? If you&#39;ve found this course interesting,
what you want to do is you want to practice you skills. Keep writing
code, keep using tags. It there is a tag you&#39;re not sure about. That is
especially the one that you want to practice with. You want to get
comfortable with multiple editors. If you&#39;ve been using Notepad++, try
Sublime. If you&#39;ve been using Sublime try Textwrangler. Keep working
with different editors, and while you&#39;re at it, try different browsers
too. Try uploading your code.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t host your site, I encourage you to find a free hosting
service and try putting it out there. Because once you can share your
code with other people you get much more motivated to do new things.</p>

<p>And finally, the most important thing you probably wanna do, is learn
about Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading Style Sheets is a method you&#39;re
gonna use to take your plain, everyday HTML file and make it look like
something special. Of course, I happen to be offering a course in CSS3,
and I hope you&#39;ll join me for that. But if you decided you just don&#39;t
have the time to do that, I want to let you know that when this course
is over and after you&#39;ve submitted your final project, I will be sending
you a link to what I call my secret lecture. And in that secret lecture,
I want to show you ways that you can style your page in very simple
steps. And I hope it&#39;s something you&#39;ll enjoy and help you to continue
your journey into HTML 5.</p>

<p>the end…</p>
